Ghesu, Vincent Christlein, Andreas Maier.",Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention -- MICCAI 2016,Deep Learning Computed Tomography,"In this paper, we demonstrate that image reconstruction can be expressed in terms of neural networks. We show that filtered back-projection can be mapped identically onto a deep neural network architecture. As for the case of iterative reconstruction, the straight forward realization as matrix multiplication is not feasible. Thus, we propose to compute the back-projection layer efficiently as fixed function and its gradient as projection operation. This allows a data-driven approach for joint optimization of correction steps in projection domain and image domain. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we are able to learn weightings and additional filter layers that consistently reduce the reconstruction error of a limited angle reconstruction by a factor of two while keeping the same computational complexity as filtered back-projection. We believe that this kind of learning approach can be extended to any common CT artifact compensation heuristic and will outperform hand-crafted artifact correction methods in the future.",[u'wuerflts@outlook.com'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46726-9_50,9e55d494-b7ac-41a5-be04-dc0ce103287f,miccai,1,2016

The proposed solution leverages Fourier Convolution Theorem to accelerate the process of learning a set of 3D filters and iteratively refine the MRI reconstruction based on the sparse codes found subsequently. In contrast to conventional CS methods which exploit the sparsity by applying universal transforms such as wavelet and total variation, our approach extracts and adapts the temporal information directly from the MRI data using compact shift-invariant 3D filters. We provide a highly parallel algorithm with GPU support for efficient computation, and therefore, the reconstruction outperforms CPU implementation of the state-of-the art dictionary learning-based approaches by up to two orders of magnitude.",[u'wkjeong@unist.ac.kr'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46726-9_56,6886df87-3ed1-40d7-a6e4-07c4dd1847b1,miccai,1,2016
"Shijie Hao, Gang Li, Li Wang, Yu Meng, Dinggang Shen.",Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention   MICCAI 2016,Learning-Based Topological Correction for Infant Cortical Surfaces,"Reconstruction of topologically correct and accurate cortical surfaces from infant MR images is of great importance in neuroimaging mapping of early brain development. However, due to rapid growth and ongoing myelination, infant MR images exhibit extremely low tissue contrast and dynamic appearance patterns, thus leading to much more topological errors (holes and handles) in the cortical surfaces derived from tissue segmentation results, in comparison to adult MR images which typically have good tissue contrast. Existing methods for topological correction either rely on the minimal correction criteria, or ad hoc rules based on image intensity priori, thus often resulting in erroneous correction and large anatomical errors in reconstructed infant cortical surfaces. To address these issues, we propose to correct topological errors by learning information from the anatomical references, i.e., manually corrected images. Specifically, in our method, we first locate candidate voxels of topologically defected regions by using a topology-preserving level set method. Then, by leveraging rich information of the corresponding patches from reference images, we build region-specific dictionaries from the anatomical references and infer the correct labels of candidate voxels using sparse representation. Notably, we further integrate these two steps into an iterative framework to enable gradual correction of large topological errors, which are frequently occurred in infant images and cannot be completely corrected using one-shot sparse representation. Extensive experiments on infant cortical surfaces demonstrate that our method not only effectively corrects the topological defects, but also leads to better anatomical consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",[u'dgshen@med.unc.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46720-7_26,a14e3e55-bba2-43e8-9fda-1a197c013b1b,miccai,1,2016

In this paper, we present the first attempt to jointly predict, using neonatal data, the dynamic growth pattern of brain cortical surfaces (collection of 3D triangular faces) and fiber tracts (collection of 3D lines). These two entities are modeled jointly as a multishape (a set of interlinked shapes). We propose a hybrid learning-based multishape prediction framework that captures both the diffeomorphic evolution of the cortical surfaces and the non-diffeomorphic growth of fiber tracts. In particular, we learn a set of geometric and dynamic cortical features and fiber connectivity features that characterize the relationships between cortical surfaces and fibers at different timepoints (0, 3, 6, and 9 months of age). Given a new neonatal multishape at 0 month of age, we hierarchically predict, at 3, 6 and 9 months, the postnatal cortical surfaces vertex-by-vertex along with fibers connected to adjacent faces to these vertices. This is achieved using a new fiber-to-face metric that quantifies the similarity between multishapes. For validation, we propose several evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the performance of our framework. The results confirm that our framework yields good prediction accuracy of complex neonatal multishape development within a few seconds.",[u'dgshen@med.unc.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46720-7_25,c1700478-be59-420d-88fb-b5dcbd8875ea,miccai,1,2016

The advantages of these high-resolution MR images include higher segmentation accuracy of MRI brain tissues. However, currently, accessibility to 7T MRI scanners remains much more limited than 3T MRI scanners due to technological and economical constraints. Hence, we propose in this work the first learning-based model that improves the segmentation of an input 3T MR image with any conventional segmentation method, through the reconstruction of a higher-quality 7T-like MR image, without actually acquiring an ultra-high-field 7T MRI. Our proposed framework comprises two main steps. First, we estimate a non-linear mapping from 3T MRI to 7T MRI space, using random forest regression model with novel weighting and ensembling schemes, to reconstruct initial 7T-like MR images. Second, we use a group sparse representation with a new pre-selection approach to further refine the 7T-like MR image reconstruction. We evaluated our 7T MRI reconstruction results along with their segmentation results using 13 subjects acquired with both 3T and 7T MR images. For tissue segmentation, we applied two widely used segmentation methods (FAST and SPM) to perform the experiments. Our results showed (1) the improvement of WM, GM and CSF brain tissues segmentation results when guided by reconstructed 7T-like images compared to 3T MR images, and (2) the outperformance of the proposed 7T MRI reconstruction method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",[u'dinggang_shen@med.unc.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46723-8_66,f348f9dd-d412-491c-ab55-530a27ff0cf0,miccai,1,2016

Accurate detection of abnormalities and correct biometric measurements hinge on the correct acquisition of clearly defined standard scan planes. Locating these standard planes requires a high level of expertise. However, there is a worldwide shortage of expert sonographers. In this paper, we consider a fully automated system based on convolutional neural networks which can detect twelve standard scan planes as defined by the UK fetal abnormality screening programme. The network design allows real-time inference and can be naturally extended to provide an approximate localisation of the fetal anatomy in the image. Such a framework can be used to automate or assist with scan plane selection, or for the retrospective retrieval of scan planes from recorded videos. The method is evaluated on a large database of 1003 volunteer mid-pregnancy scans. We show that standard planes acquired in a clinical scenario are robustly detected with a precision and recall of 69 % and 80 %, which is superior to the current state-of-the-art.

Then, we identify if each patch sequence contains mitosis event or not using a hieratical convolutional neural network. In the experiments, we validate the design of our proposed architecture and evaluate the mitosis event detection performance. Our method achieves 99.1 % precision and 97.2 % recall in very challenging image sequences of multipolar-shaped C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

However, due to the requirements for long acquisition and breath-hold, the clinical routine is still dominated by multi-slice 2D imaging, which hamper the visualization of anatomy and quantitative measurements as relatively thick slices are acquired. As a solution, we propose a novel image super-resolution (SR) approach that is based on a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It reconstructs high resolution 3D volumes from 2D image stacks for more accurate image analysis. The proposed model allows the use of multiple input data acquired from different viewing planes for improved performance. Experimental results on 1233 cardiac short and long-axis MR image stacks show that the CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods in terms of image quality while being computationally efficient. Also, we show that image segmentation and motion tracking benefits more from SR-CNN when it is used as an initial upscaling method than conventional interpolation methods for the subsequent analysis.",[u'o.oktay13@imperial.ac.uk'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46726-9_29,adc9c811-a3c2-454d-9c30-87ced207e823,miccai,1,2016

Thus, accurate prognosis for glioma patients would provide essential guidelines for their treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction generally utilizes clinical information and limited handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images (MRI), which is often time consuming, laborious and subjective. In this paper, we propose using deep learning frameworks to automatically extract features from multi-modal preoperative brain images (i.e., T1 MRI, fMRI and DTI) of high-grade glioma patients. Specifically, we adopt 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and also propose a new network architecture for using multi-channel data and learning supervised features. Along with the pivotal clinical features, we finally train a support vector machine to predict if the patient has a long or short overall survival (OS) time. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can achieve an accuracy as high as 89.9 % We also find that the learned features from fMRI and DTI play more important roles in accurately predicting the OS time, which provides valuable insights into functional neuro-oncological applications.",[u'dgshen@med.unc.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46723-8_25,6db9349a-0156-4513-bdf0-473317bed8d1,miccai,1,2016

Conventional GTL approaches first construct a fixed subject-wise graph based on the similarities of observed features (i.e., extracted from imaging data) in the feature domain, and then follow the established graph to propagate the existing labels from training to testing data in the label domain. However, such a graph is exclusively learned in the feature domain and may not be necessarily optimal in the label domain. This may eventually undermine the classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a progressive GTL (pGTL) method to progressively find an intrinsic data representation. To achieve this, our pGTL method iteratively (1) refines the subject-wise relationships observed in the feature domain using the learned intrinsic data representation in the label domain, (2) updates the intrinsic data representation from the refined subject-wise relationships, and (3) verifies the intrinsic data representation on the training data, in order to guarantee an optimal classification on the new testing data. Furthermore, we extend our pGTL to incorporate multi-modal imaging data, to improve the classification accuracy and robustness as multi-modal imaging data can provide complementary information.

Thus, it is an important topic to use neuroimaging measures to predict cognitive performance and track the progression of AD. Many existing cognitive performance prediction methods employ the regression models to associate cognitive scores to neuroimaging measures, but these methods do not take into account the interconnected structures within imaging data and those among cognitive scores. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-task learning model for minimizing the k smallest singular values to uncover the underlying low-rank common subspace and jointly analyze all the imaging and clinical data.

Several multi-view learning methods have recently been developed to deal with missing data, with each view corresponding to a specific modality or a combination of several modalities. However, existing methods usually ignore the underlying coherence among views, which may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. In this paper, we propose a view-aligned hypergraph learning (VAHL) method to explicitly model the coherence among the views. Specifically, we first divide the original data into several views based on possible combinations of modalities, followed by a sparse representation based hypergraph construction process in each view. A view-aligned hypergraph classification (VAHC) model is then proposed, by using a view-aligned regularizer to model the view coherence. We further assemble the class probability scores generated from VAHC via a multi-view label fusion method to make a final classification decision. We evaluate our method on the baseline ADNI-1 database having 807 subjects and three modalities (i.e., MRI, PET, and CSF).

The presence of enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) signals the onset or progression of a malignant disease or infection. In the thoracoabdominal (TA) body region, neighboring enlarged LNs often spatially collapse into swollen lymph node clusters (LNCs) (up to 9 LNs in our dataset). Accurate segmentation of TA LNCs is complexified by the noticeably poor intensity and texture contrast among neighboring LNs and surrounding tissues, and has not been addressed in previous work. This paper presents a novel approach to TA LNC segmentation that combines holistically-nested neural networks (HNNs) and structured optimization (SO). Two HNNs, built upon recent fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and deeply supervised networks (DSNs), are trained to learn the LNC appearance (HNN-A) or contour (HNN-C) probabilistic output maps, respectively. HNN first produces the class label maps with the same resolution as the input image, like FCN. Afterwards, HNN predictions for LNC appearance and contour cues are formulated into the unary and pairwise terms of conditional random fields (CRFs), which are subsequently solved using one of three different SO methods: dense CRF, graph cuts, and boundary neural fields (BNF). BNF yields the highest quantitative results. Its mean Dice coefficient between segmented and ground truth LN volumes is 82.1 %  9.6 %, compared to 73.0 %  17.6 % for HNN-A alone.

Clinical diagnosis by physicians manual segmentation is inefficient and laborious. Automated diagnosis is highly desirable but faces the class overlapping problem derived from the diverse shape and size. In this paper, a fully automated diagnosis approach is proposed for NFS. It is based on a newly proposed synchronized superpixels representation (SSR) model where a highly discriminative feature space is obtained for accurately and easily classifying neural foramina into normal and stenosed classes. To achieve it, class labels (0:normal,1:stenosed) are integrated to guide manifold alignment which correlates images from the same class, so that intra-class difference is reduced and the inter-class margin are maximized. The overall result reaches a high accuracy (\(98.52\,\%\)) in 110 mid-sagittal MR spine images collected from 110 subjects.

Consequently, huge receptive fields are required which might lead to disproportionate computational demand.

How to utilize unannotated images for training effective segmentation models is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a new deep adversarial network (DAN) model for biomedical image segmentation, aiming to attain consistently good segmentation results on both annotated and unannotated images. Our model consists of two networks: (1) a segmentation network (SN) to conduct segmentation; (2) an evaluation network (EN) to assess segmentation quality. During training, EN is encouraged to distinguish between segmentation results of unannotated images and annotated ones (by giving them different scores), while SN is encouraged to produce segmentation results of unannotated images such that EN cannot distinguish these from the annotated ones.

As the human functional connectome consists of multiple large-scale communities (e.g., the default mode and fronto-parietal networks), we dichotomized connectivity profiles of lesional patches into connectivity to the cortices belonging to the same functional community (intra-community) and to other communities (inter-community). Clustering these community-based patch profiles in 27 patients with histologically-proven FCD objectively identified three distinct lesional classes with (1) decreased intra- and inter-community connectivity, (2) decreased intra-community but normal inter-community connectivity, and (3) increased intra- as well as inter-community connectivity, relative to 34 healthy controls.

The data come from repeated observations of subjects at different time points which take the form of measurement maps distributed on a graph such as an image or a mesh.

The subject-specific trajectories are defined via spatial and temporal transformations of the group-average scenario, thus estimating the variability of spatiotemporal patterns within the group. To estimate population and individual model parameters, we adapted a stochastic version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the MCMC-SAEM.

Elhabian.",Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention  MICCAI 2017,Learning Deep Features for Automated Placement of Correspondence Points on Ensembles of Complex Shapes,"Correspondence-based shape models are an enabling technology for various medical imaging applications that rely on statistical analysis of populations of anatomical shape. One strategy for automatic correspondence placement is to simultaneously learn a compact representation of the underlying anatomical variation in the shape space while capturing the geometric characteristics of individual shapes. The inherent geometric complexity and population-level shape variation in anatomical structures introduce significant challenges in finding optimal shape correspondence models. Existing approaches adopt iterative optimization schemes with objective functions derived from probabilistic modeling of shape space, e.g. entropy of Gaussian-distributed shape space, to find useful sets of dense correspondence on shape ensembles. Nonetheless, anatomical shape distributions can be far more complex than this Gaussian assumption, which entails linear shape variation. Recent works address this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of correspondence through lifting positional data to a higher-dimensional feature space (e.g. sulcal depth, brain connectivity, and geodesic distance to anatomical landmarks), with the goal of simplifying the optimization problem. However, this typically requires a careful selection of hand-crafted features and their success heavily rely on expertise in finding such features consistently. This paper proposes an automated feature learning approach using deep convolutional neural networks for optimization of dense point correspondence on shape ensembles. The proposed method endows anatomical shapes with learned features that enhance the shape correspondence objective function to deal with complex objects and populations. Results demonstrate that deep learning based features perform better than methods that rely on position and compete favorably with hand-crafted features.",[u'prafulag@cs.utah.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66182-7_22,4b8bce6f-46c8-4917-a911-7e6559f990af,miccai,1,2017

The method relies on a fully convolutional network whose architecture consists of contracting layers to detect relevant features and a symmetric expanding path that matches them together and outputs the transformation parametrization. Whereas convolutional networks have seen a widespread expansion and have been already applied to many medical imaging problems such as segmentation and classification, its application to registration has so far faced the challenge of defining ground truth data on which to train the algorithm. Here, we present a novel training strategy to build reference deformations which relies on the registration of segmented regions of interest. We apply this methodology to the problem of inter-patient heart registration and show an important improvement over a state of the art optimization based algorithm.

Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation significantly, however these models tend to generalise poorly to different imaging modalities than those for which they have been designed, thereby limiting their applications.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, (1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, (2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset. The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.",[u'mehrtash@bwh.harvard.edu'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66179-7_59,5fb6157d-69e9-40d6-8542-5c9ef50c68c7,miccai,1,2017

High variability in the location and extent of IVH and in the shape and size of the ventricles due to ventriculomegaly (VM), combined with a lack of large sets of training images covering all possible configurations, mean it is not feasible to approach the problem using whole brain dictionary learning.

Two key pathological signs of NMOSD and MS that are detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are white matter lesions and alterations in tissue integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) values on diffusion tensor images (DTIs). This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model that discovers latent features in brain lesion masks and DTIs for distinguishing NMOSD from MS. The main technical challenge is to optimally extract and integrate features from two very heterogeneous image types (lesion masks and FA maps). Our solution is to first build two modality-specific pathways, each designed to accommodate the expected feature density and scale, then integrate them into a hierarchical multimodal fusion (HMF) model. The HMF model contains two multimodal fusion layers operating at two different scales, which in turn are joined by a multi-scale fusion layer. We hypothesize that the HMF approach would allow the automatic extraction of joint-features of heterogeneous image types to be optimized with greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional multimodal approach of combining only the top-layer modality-specific features with a single fusion layer. The proposed model gives an average diagnostic accuracy of 81.3% (85.3% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity) on 82 NMOSD patients and 52 MS patients in a seven-fold cross-validation, which significantly outperforms the user-defined MRI features previously used in clinical studies, as well as deep-learned features using the conventional fusion approach.",[u'youngjin.yoo@alumni.ubc.ca'],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66179-7_55,681497a6-3ffd-43e6-8dd4-350cf0860647,miccai,1,2017

We propose to use a multi-channel image-to-image convolutional encoder-decoders where responses signify localized lesions and output channels represent different tumor classes. We take simple point locations in the labeled ground truth data and train networks to output Gaussian kernels around those points across multiple channels.

Evidences show that these two modalities provide complementary visual features that can empower the decision making process.

The large numbers of images in routine liver CT studies, in addition to their high diversity in appearance, have been hurdles for detecting all lesions by visual inspection. Automated methods for lesion identification are desirable, but the results of current approaches are limited due to the diversity of the training sets and the extensive tuning of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel saliency model for lesion detection in CT images. First, we segment the image into multi-scale patch sizes. Then, a two-stage saliency model is proposed to detect liver lesions. In the first stage, we calculate the gray level contrast saliency map based on a prior knowledge to reduce the influence of blood vessels in CT images. In the second stage, we propose a modified sparse autoencoder (SAE) with neighbourhood information to learn discriminative features directly from raw patch features and adopt Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) method to encode the obtained discriminative features of each patch. Then the second saliency map is calculated based on feature uniqueness and spatial distribution of patches. Followed by an appropriate mapping fusion, the liver lesions can be detected well.

This process often involves bone segmentation and landmark digitization. Since anatomical landmarks generally lie on the boundaries of segmented bone regions, the tasks of bone segmentation and landmark digitization could be highly correlated. However, most existing methods simply treat them as two standalone tasks, without considering their inherent association. In addition, these methods usually ignore the spatial context information (i.e., displacements from voxels to landmarks) in CBCT images. To this end, we propose a context-guided fully convolutional network (FCN) for joint bone segmentation and landmark digitization. Specifically, we first train an FCN to learn the displacement maps to capture the spatial context information in CBCT images. Using the learned displacement maps as guidance information, we further develop a multi-task FCN to jointly perform bone segmentation and landmark digitization.

This problem is a key task in various quantitative analysis applications in neuroscience, such as tracing cell genesis in Danio rerio (zebrafish) brains. Deep learning, especially using fully convolutional networks (FCN), has profoundly changed segmentation research in biomedical imaging. We face two major challenges in this problem. First, neuronal cells may form dense clusters, making it difficult to correctly identify all individual cells (even to human experts). Consequently, segmentation results of the known FCN-type models are not accurate enough. Second, pixel-wise ground truth is difficult to obtain. Only a limited amount of approximate instance-wise annotation can be collected, which makes the training of FCN models quite cumbersome. We propose a new FCN-type deep learning model, called deep complete bipartite networks (CB-Net), and a new scheme for leveraging approximate instance-wise annotation to train our pixel-wise prediction model.

The ill-defined boundaries of optic cup makes the segmentation a lot more challenging compared to optic disc. Existing approaches have mainly used fully supervised learning that requires many labeled samples to build a robust segmentation framework. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method to segment the optic cup, which can accurately localize the anatomy using limited number of labeled samples. The proposed method leverages the inherent feature similarity from a large number of unlabeled images to train the segmentation model from a smaller number of labeled images. It first learns the parameters of a generative model from unlabeled images using variational autoencoder. The trained generative model provides the feature embedding of the images which allows the clustering of the related observation in the latent feature space. We combine the feature embedding with the segmentation autoencoder which is trained on the labeled images for pixel-wise segmentation of the cup region. The main novelty of the proposed approach is in the utilization of generative models for semi-supervised segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully segments optic cup with small number of labeled images, and unsupervised feature embedding learned from unlabeled data improves the segmentation accuracy.

Two key pathological signs of NMOSD and MS that are detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are white matter lesions and alterations in tissue integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) values on diffusion tensor images (DTIs). This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model that discovers latent features in brain lesion masks and DTIs for distinguishing NMOSD from MS. The main technical challenge is to optimally extract and integrate features from two very heterogeneous image types (lesion masks and FA maps). Our solution is to first build two modality-specific pathways, each designed to accommodate the expected feature density and scale, then integrate them into a hierarchical multimodal fusion (HMF) model. The HMF model contains two multimodal fusion layers operating at two different scales, which in turn are joined by a multi-scale fusion layer. We hypothesize that the HMF approach would allow the automatic extraction of joint-features of heterogeneous image types to be optimized with greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional multimodal approach of combining only the top-layer modality-specific features with a single fusion layer.

However, most of the existing MTL algorithms are formulated linear sparse models, in which the response (e.g., cognitive score) is a linear function of predictors (e.g., neuroimaging measures). To exploit the nonlinear relationship between the neuroimaging measures and cognitive measures, we consider that tasks to be learned share a common subset of features in the kernel space as well as the kernel functions.

To interpret a breast MRI study, a radiologist has to examine over 1000 images, and integrate spatial and temporal information from multiple sequences. The automated detection and classification of suspicious lesions can help reduce the workload and improve accuracy. We describe a hybrid mass-detection algorithm that combines unsupervised candidate detection with deep learning-based classification. The detection algorithm first identifies image-salient regions, as well as regions that are cross-salient with respect to the contralateral breast image. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the detected candidates into true-positive and false-positive masses. The network uses a novel multi-channel image representation; this representation encompasses information from the anatomical and kinetic image features, as well as saliency maps. We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset of MRI studies from 171 patients, with 1957 annotated slices of malignant (59%) and benign (41%) masses. Unsupervised saliency-based detection provided a sensitivity of 0.96 with 9.7 false-positive detections per slice. Combined with CNN classification, the number of false positive detections dropped to 0.7 per slice, with 0.85 sensitivity. The multi-channel representation achieved higher classification performance compared to single-channel images.

Thus, instead of directly using the predefined features as popularly used in the conventional methods, we propose to learn the latent feature representations of infant MR brain images by unsupervised deep learning. Since deep learning paradigms can learn low-level features and then successfully build up more comprehensive high-level features in a layer-by-layer manner, such hierarchical feature representations can be more competitive for distinguishing the hippocampus from entire brain images. To this end, we apply Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) to learn the deep feature representations from both T1- and T2-weighed MR images combining their complementary information, which is important for characterizing different development stages of infant brains after birth.

However, most of the published work has been confined to solving 2D problems, with a few limited exceptions that treated the 3D space as a composition of 2D orthogonal planes. The challenge of 3D deep learning is due to a much larger input vector, compared to 2D, which dramatically increases the computation time and the chance of over-fitting, especially when combined with limited training samples (hundreds to thousands), typical for medical imaging applications. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient and robust deep learning algorithm capable of full 3D detection in volumetric data. A two-step approach is exploited for efficient detection. A shallow network (with one hidden layer) is used for the initial testing of all voxels to obtain a small number of promising candidates, followed by more accurate classification with a deep network. In addition, we propose two approaches, i.e., separable filter decomposition and network sparsification, to speed up the evaluation of a network. To mitigate the over-fitting issue, thereby increasing detection robustness, we extract small 3D patches from a multi-resolution image pyramid.

Specifically, we devise a hybrid architecture by combining Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The roles of DAE and HMM are, respectively, to discover hierarchical non-linear relations among features, by which we transform the original features into a lower dimension space, and to model dynamic characteristics inherent in rs-fMRI, i.e., internal state changes. By building a generative model with HMMs for each class individually, we estimate the data likelihood of a test subject as MCI or normal healthy control, based on which we identify the clinical label.

In particular, the structured prediction models are estimated with loss minimization parameter learning algorithms, representing: a) conditional random field (CRF), and b) structured support vector machine (SSVM). For the CRF model, we use the inference algorithm based on tree re-weighted belief propagation with truncated fitting training, and for the SSVM model the inference is based on graph cuts with maximum margin training. We show empirically the importance of deep learning methods in producing state-of-the-art results for both structured prediction models. In addition, we show that our methods produce results that can be considered the best results to date on DDSM-BCRP and INbreast databases.

We then propose a novel method, called ShrinkConnect, for reducing the computations of LSDN without sacrificing synthesis accuracy. ShrinkConnect enforces simultaneous sparsity to find a compact set of functions that accurately approximates the responses of all hidden nodes.

Two main challenges to be solved are the low efficiency in scanning large volumetric input images and the need for manual engineering of image features. This work proposes Marginal Space Deep Learning (MSDL) as an effective solution, that combines the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces with the automated feature design of Deep Learning (DL) network architectures. Representation learning through DL automatically identifies, disentangles and learns explanatory factors directly from low-level image data. However, the direct application of DL to volumetric data results in a very high complexity, due to the increased number of transformation parameters. For example, the number of parameters defining a similarity transformation increases to 9 in 3D (3 for location, 3 for orientation and 3 for scale). The mechanism of marginal space learning provides excellent run-time performance by learning classifiers in high probability regions in spaces of gradually increasing dimensionality, for example starting from location only (3D) to location and orientation (6D) and full parameter space (9D). In addition, for parametrized feature computation, we propose to simplify the network by replacing the standard, pre-determined feature sampling pattern with a sparse, adaptive, self-learned pattern. The MSDL framework is evaluated on detecting the aortic heart valve in 3D ultrasound data. The dataset contains 3795 volumes from 150 patients.

However, the duality nature of these two structures causes lots of ambiguity for their detection in H&E histology tissue images, especially when multiple instances are clustered together. Based on the observation that once such an object is detected for certain, the ambiguity in the neighborhood of the detected object can be reduced considerably, we propose to combine deep learning and domain knowledge in a unified framework, to simultaneously detect (the closely related) glands and villi in H&E histology tissue images. Our method iterates between exploring domain knowledge and performing deep learning classification, and the two components benefit from each other. (1) By exploring domain knowledge, the generated object proposals (to be fed to deep learning) form a more complete coverage of the true objects and the segmentation of object proposals can be more accurate, thus improving deep learnings performance on classification. (2) Deep learning can help verify the class of each object proposal, and provide feedback to repeatedly refresh and enhance domain knowledge so that more reliable object proposals can be generated later on.

In contrast to existing automatic feature learning approaches, which are typically patch-based, our model learns features from entire images, which eliminates patch selection and redundant calculations at the overlap of neighboring patches and thereby speeds up the training. Our network also uses a novel objective function that works well for segmenting underrepresented classes, such as MS lesions. We have evaluated our method on the publicly available labeled cases from the MS lesion segmentation challenge 2008 data set, showing that our method performs comparably to the state-of-theart.

However, in H&E histology tissue slides, the appearances of neutrophils are highly variable due to morphology, staining and locations. Further, the noisy and complex tissue environment causes artifacts resembling neutrophils. Thus, it is challenging to design, in a hand-crafted manner, computerized features that help identify neutrophils effectively. To better characterize neutrophils, we propose to extract their features in a learning manner, by constructing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, in clinical practice, neutrophils are identified not only based on their individual appearance, but also on the context formed by multiple related cells. It is not quite straightforward for deep learning to capture precisely the rather complex cell context. Hence, we further propose to combine deep learning with Voronoi diagram of clusters (VDC), to extract needed context.

Second, we show that multiview classification is possible without the pre-registration of the input images. Rather, we use the high-level features produced by the CNNs trained in each view separately.

The study included CCTA scans of 50 patients equally distributed over five cardiovascular risk categories. CAC in CCTA was identified in two stages. In the first stage, potential CAC voxels were identified using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
