0,Integrating Online and Offline Three-Dimensional Deep Learning for Automated Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Videos,L. Yu; H. Chen; Q. Dou; J. Qin; P. A. Heng,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,20170520.0,2017,21.0,1.0,65,75,"Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos has been demonstrated to be a promising way for colorectal cancer prevention and diagnosis. Traditional manual screening is time consuming, operator dependent, and error prone; hence, automated detection approach is highly demanded in clinical practice. However, automated polyp detection is very challenging due to high intraclass variations in polyp size, color, shape, and texture, and low interclass variations between polyps and hard mimics. In this paper, we propose a novel offline and online three-dimensional (3-D) deep learning integration framework by leveraging the 3-D fully convolutional network (3D-FCN) to tackle this challenging problem. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or 2-D convolutional neural network, the 3D-FCN is capable of learning more representative spatio-temporal features from colonoscopy videos, and hence has more powerful discrimination capability. More importantly, we propose a novel online learning scheme to deal with the problem of limited training data by harnessing the specific information of an input video in the learning process. We integrate offline and online learning to effectively reduce the number of false positives generated by the offline network and further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on the dataset of MICCAI 2015 Challenge on Polyp Detection demonstrated the better performance of our method when compared with other competitors.",2168-2194;21682194,,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2637004,Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776845,Automated polyp detection;colonoscopy video;computer-aided diagnosis;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning,Cancer;Colonoscopy;Feature extraction;MIMICs;Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Videos,cancer;endoscopes;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;video signal processing,3D fully convolutional network;automated polyp detection;colonoscopy videos;colorectal cancer diagnosis;colorectal cancer prevention;offline three-dimensional deep learning integration framework;online three-dimensional deep learning integration framework;spatiotemporal features,,,,,,,20161207.0,Jan. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
1,Automatic Detection and Classification of Colorectal Polyps by Transferring Low-Level CNN Features From Nonmedical Domain,R. Zhang; Y. Zheng; T. W. C. Mak; R. Yu; S. H. Wong; J. Y. W. Lau; C. C. Y. Poon,"Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,20170520.0,2017,21.0,1.0,41,47,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although polypectomy at early stage reduces CRC incidence, 90% of the polyps are small and diminutive, where removal of them poses risks to patients that may outweigh the benefits. Correctly detecting and predicting polyp type during colonoscopy allows endoscopists to resect and discard the tissue without submitting it for histology, saving time, and costs. Nevertheless, human visual observation of early stage polyps varies. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a fully automatic algorithm to detect and classify hyperplastic and adenomatous colorectal polyps. Adenomatous polyps should be removed, whereas distal diminutive hyperplastic polyps are considered clinically insignificant and may be left in situ . A novel transfer learning application is proposed utilizing features learned from big nonmedical datasets with 1.4-2.5 million images using deep convolutional neural network. The endoscopic images we collected for experiment were taken under random lighting conditions, zooming and optical magnification, including 1104 endoscopic nonpolyp images taken under both white-light and narrowband imaging (NBI) endoscopy and 826 NBI endoscopic polyp images, of which 263 images were hyperplasia and 563 were adenoma as confirmed by histology. The proposed method identified polyp images from nonpolyp images in the beginning followed by predicting the polyp histology. When compared with visual inspection by endoscopists, the results of this study show that the proposed method has similar precision (87.3% versus 86.4%) but a higher recall rate (87.6% versus 77.0%) and a higher accuracy (85.9% versus 74.3%). In conclusion, automatic algorithms can assist endoscopists in identifying polyps that are adenomatous but have been incorrectly judged as hyperplasia and, therefore, enable timely resection of these polyps at an early stage before they develop into invasive cancer.",2168-2194;21682194,,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635662,"Chow Yuk Ho Technology Centre for Innovative Medicine; Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund, Shaw Endoscopy Center; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7769237,Colorectal cancer;deep learning;health informatics;polyp diagnosis,Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Colonoscopy;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neurons;Training,biological tissues;biomedical optical imaging;cancer;endoscopes,NBI endoscopic polyp images;adenomatous colorectal polyps;cancer deaths;colonoscopy;colorectal cancer;colorectal polyps automatic detection;colorectal polyps classification;deep convolutional neural network;endoscopic images;endoscopic nonpolyp images;fully automatic algorithm;human visual observation;hyperplasia;hyperplastic colorectal polyps;learning application;low-level CNN features;narrowband imaging endoscopy;nonmedical datasets;optical magnification;polyp histology;polypectomy;tissue;white-light endoscopy,,,,,,,20161205.0,Jan. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Besides, age and gender introduce additional difficulties to the detection process. It is hard to determine whether a single pixel is skin or nonskin without considering the context. An efficient traditional hand-engineered skin color detection algorithm requires extensive work by domain experts. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in pixel-wise labeling tasks. However, CNN-based architectures are not sufficient for modeling the relationship between pixels and their neighbors. In this letter, we integrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) layers into the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), and develop an end-to-end network for human skin detection. In particular, FCN layers capture generic local features, while RNN layers model the semantic contextual dependencies in images.

Despite a number of prior attempts, this task remains very challenging, especially when images are contaminated by noises or have discontinued segments of neurite patterns. An approach for addressing such problems is to identify the locations of neuronal voxels using image segmentation methods, prior to applying tracing or reconstruction techniques. This preprocessing step is expected to remove noises in the data, thereby leading to improved reconstruction results. In this paper, we proposed to use 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting the neuronal microscopy images. Specifically, we designed a novel CNN architecture, that takes volumetric images as the inputs and their voxel-wise segmentation maps as the outputs. The developed architecture allows us to train and predict using large microscopy images in an end-to-end manner.

Traditionally, clinical experts manually categorize the images captured into different skin layers. This time-consuming labeling task impedes the convenient analysis of skin image datasets. In recent automated image recognition tasks, deep learning with convolutional neural nets (CNN) has achieved remarkable results. However in many clinical settings, training data is often limited and insufficient for CNN training. For recognition of RCM skin images, we demonstrate that a CNN trained on a moderate size dataset leads to low accuracy. We introduce a hybrid deep learning approach which uses traditional texton-based feature vectors as input to train a deep neural network. This hybrid method uses fixed filters in the input layer instead of tuned filters, yet superior performance is achieved. Our dataset consists of 1500 images from 15 RCM stacks belonging to six different categories of skin layers. We show that our hybrid deep learning approach performs with a test accuracy of 82% compared with 51% for CNN.

Liu,"School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.",IEEE Access,,2017,PP,99.0,1,1,"We present an approach to jointly detect mitotic events spatially and temporally in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy images. In particular, we combine a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to detect mitotic events in patch sequences. The CNN-LSTM network can be trained end-to-end to simultaneously learn convolutional features within each frame and temporal dynamics between frames, without hand-crafted visual or temporal feature design. Owing to the LSTM layer, this approach is able to detect mitotic events in patch sequences of variable length, as well as making use of longer context information among frames in the sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to detect mitosis using deep learning in both spatial and temporal domains. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM network can be trained efficiently, and we evaluate this design by applying the network to original raw microscopy image sequences to locate mitotic events both spatially and temporally. The data we validate the proposed method on include C3H10 mesenchymal and C2C12 myoblastic stem cell populations. Our approach achieved the F score of 98.72% on the C2C12 dataset, and the F score of 96.5% on the C3H10 dataset. The results on both datasets outperform traditional graph model based approaches by a large margin, both in terms of detection accuracy and frame localization accuracy. Furthermore, we have developed a framework to aid humans in annotating mitosis with high efficiency and accuracy in raw phase contrast microscopy images based on the joint detection results using the proposed method.

Karande,,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),20170824.0,2017,,,786,793,"Metaphase chromosome analysis is one of the primary techniques utilized in cytogenetics. Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not easily separable by image processing techniques. Many techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification. Experiments are performed on 400 real healthy patient images obtained from a hospital. Results are encouraging and promise to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of segmenting and karyotyping chromosomes.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0733-6; POD:978-1-5386-0734-3,10.1109/CVPRW.2017.109,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8014843,,Biological cells;Conferences;Crowdsourcing;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Microscopy;Pipelines,,,,,,,,,,21-26 July 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Today the diagnoses are determined by pathologists manually, which is both a complex and a time-consuming task. To reduce the pathologists' workload, but also to reduce variations between different pathologists, an automatic classification system would be of great use. Some previous works have aimed for this, but still more work needs to be done. It is probable that such a tool would benefit from having access to individually segmented, pathologically relevant objects from the images. Therefore, we have developed an algorithm for semantic segmentation of the microscopic images of H&E stained prostate tissue into Background, Stroma, Epithelial Cytoplasm and Nuclei. This algorithm is based on deep learning, or more specifically a convolutional neural network. The network design is inspired by architectures that previously have been proved successful in different applications. It consists of a contracting and an expanding part, which are symmetrical.

Navab,"Australian Centre for Visual Technologies, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,20170628.0,2017,36,7.0,1405,1417,"In recently published clinical trial results, hypoxia-modified therapies have shown to provide more positive outcomes to cancer patients, compared with standard cancer treatments. The development and validation of these hypoxia-modified therapies depend on an effective way of measuring tumor hypoxia, but a standardized measurement is currently unavailable in clinical practice. Different types of manual measurements have been proposed in clinical research, but in this paper we focus on a recently published approach that quantifies the number and proportion of hypoxic regions using high resolution (immuno-)fluorescence (IF) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained images of a histological specimen of a tumor. We introduce new machine learning-based methodologies to automate this measurement, where the main challenge is the fact that the clinical annotations available for training the proposed methodologies consist of the total number of normoxic, chronically hypoxic, and acutely hypoxic regions without any indication of their location in the image. Therefore, this represents a weakly-supervised structured output classification problem, where training is based on a high-order loss function formed by the norm of the difference between the manual and estimated annotations mentioned above. We propose four methodologies to solve this problem: 1) a naive method that uses a majority classifier applied on the nodes of a fixed grid placed over the input images; 2) a baseline method based on a structured output learning formulation that relies on a fixed grid placed over the input images; 3) an extension to this baseline based on a latent structured output learning formulation that uses a graph that is flexible in terms of the amount and positions of nodes; and 4) a pixel-wise labeling based on a fully-convolutional neural network. Using a data set of 89 weakly annotated pairs of IF and HE images from eight tumors, we show that the quantitativ- results of methods (3) and (4) above are equally competitive and superior to the naive (1) and baseline (2) methods.

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error.

Such automation could be beneficial to obtain fast and precise quantification, reduce observer variability, and increase objectivity. In this work, we propose to classify breast cancer histopathology images independent of their magnifications using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose two different architectures; single task CNN is used to predict malignancy and multi-task CNN is used to predict both malignancy and image magnification level simultaneously.

Our results in this limited set of training data are comparable with previous state-of-the-art results obtained by hand-crafted features.

In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers) can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for accurate skin lesion segmentation, and further enhance its capability by incorporating a multi-scale contextual information integration scheme. Finally, we seamlessly integrate the proposed FCRN (for segmentation) and other very deep residual networks (for classification) to form a two-stage framework. This framework enables the classification network to extract more representative and specific features based on segmented results instead of the whole dermoscopy images, further alleviating the insufficiency of training data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on ISBI 2016 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed framework, ranking the first in classification and the second in segmentation among 25 teams and 28 teams, r- spectively.

A key step in obtaining the reconstruction is the ability to automatically segment neurons with a precision close to human-level performance. Despite the recent technical advances in EM image segmentation, most of them rely on hand-crafted features to some extent that are specific to the data, limiting their ability to generalize. Here, we propose a simple yet powerful technique for EM image segmentation that is trained end-to-end and does not rely on prior knowledge of the data. Our proposed residual deconvolutional network consists of two information pathways that capture full-resolution features and contextual information, respectively. We showed that the proposed model is very effective in achieving the conflicting goals in dense output prediction; namely preserving full-resolution predictions and including sufficient contextual information. We applied our method to the ongoing open challenge of 3D neurite segmentation in EM images. Our method achieved one of the top results on this open challenge. We demonstrated the generality of our technique by evaluating it on the 2D neurite segmentation challenge dataset where consistently high performance was obtained. We thus expect our method to generalize well to other dense output prediction problems.",0278-0062;02780062,,10.1109/TMI.2016.2613019,"10.13039/100000153 - National Science Foundation, Old Dominion University, and Washington State University; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575638,Brain circuit reconstruction;deconvolutional networks;deep learning;electron microscopy;image segmentation;residual learning,Convolution;Deconvolution;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Predictive models;Three-dimensional displays,brain;deconvolution;electron microscopy;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology,3D neurite segmentation;EM image segmentation;anatomical connection reconstruction;brain electron microscopy;circuit mapping;contextual information;dense output prediction;electron microscopy images;full-resolution features;full-resolution predictions;hand-crafted features;human-level performance;information pathways;neurite segmentation challenge dataset;neurons;residual deconvolutional networks,,,,,,,20160923.0,Feb. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

In most computational techniques proposed to automate the diagnostic procedure, accurate segmentation is paramount as a precursor to the extraction of relevant morphometric features. Since the ultimate goal of segmentation is generally classification, yet a given class imparts an expected tissue appearance beneficial to segmentation, we pose the problem of automatic tissue analysis as the joint task of segmentation and classification. We propose a novel multi-objective learning method that optimizes a single unified deep fully convolutional neural network with two distinct loss functions.

These models are developed in the context of microscopy imaging of malignant tumours, where the estimation of the number and proportion of classes of microcirculatory supply units (MCSU) is important in the assessment of the efficacy of common cancer treatments (an MCSU is a region of the tumour tissue supplied by a microvessel). The proposed methodologies take as input multimodal microscopy images of a tumour, and estimate the number and proportion of MCSU classes. This estimation is facilitated by the use of an underlying latent graph (not present in the manual annotations), where each MCSU is represented by a node in this graph, labelled with the MCSU class and image location. The training process uses the manual weak annotations available, consisting of the number of MCSU classes per training image, where the training objective is the minimisation of a high-order loss function based on the norm of the error between the manual and estimated annotations. One of the models proposed is based on a new flexible latent structure support vector machine (FLSSVM) and the other is based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model.

Predictive metrology and analytics offer Multivariate data with non-linear trends and complex correlations generally cannot be described well by mathematical models but can be relatively easily learned by computing machines and used to predict or extrapolate. In this paper we present the application of machine learning and analytics to accurately predict the electrical performance of deep trenches and metal lines. Machine learning models can be used in process control where, for example, the electrical test results are predicted early in the processing flow invoking appropriate actionable decisions. It is demonstrated that metal line resistance can be modeled directly by the raw reflectance spectra obtained using scatterometry tool. This obviates the need to make complex geometrical models to measure the CDs and then establishing the correlation of CDs to resistance. It is shown that dimensional parameters such as height and CD can be derived from the predicted electrical measurements. Such information can be used in feedforward or feedback flow to optimize, control or monitor processes in fab. Results show improved correlation of neural network model predicted deep trench capacitance to the measured capacitance compared to the capacitance predicted by multivariate linear regression model that is currently in use.

Health promotion is recognized as a viable approach to preventing diseases and disorders and promoting changes in health behaviors or practices. Each year, oral cancer kills more people in the US than does cervical cancer, malignant melanoma, or Hodgkin's disease. A first line of defense against oral diseases is an orofacial selfexamination. The goal of this experiment titled ""Oro Vision"" is to provide an assessment tool for field workers to perform initial examinations of orofacial diseases, using a camera enabled mobile phone. For this experiment, we chose to implement Oro Vision to detect mouth sores. The goal is to extend this model to identify several other Oral diseases such as Thrush, Leukoplakia, Lichenplanus, etc. One variety of mouth sore, referred to as the ""cold sore"" is highly contagious and an infected person can easily pass on the infection to another person just through skin to skin contact.

Prevention and early intervention are the most powerful tools in ameliorating the problem, and therefore, timely and accurate detection of abnormal emotional patterns is of vital importance. In this paper, we propose a system that detects second-level emotional states of children using hour-level audio recordings. The proposed system consists of an audio segmentation and speaker tracking front-end along with an emotion recognition back-end. Supervised support vector machine is used in the front-end to improve its robustness to short and inconsistent child speech pattern and end-to-end deep learning is used in the emotion recognition back-end to improve its robustness to noise and segmentation error.

Services and systems related to automatic recording of healthcare management of elderly people have been proposed in order to reduce the burden of nursing care. Water intake is one of the items necessary for healthcare management of elderly people. However, it is not currently automated, which is a burden on caregivers. In the case of the conventional method, the swallowing sound is used for estimating the water intake. However, the estimation error for each subject is large. Accuracy of estimated water intake is improved by using deep learning. Specifically, three features, namely, mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), duration of water intake, and a RASTA filter auditory spectrum, are extracted from a subject's swallowing sound (which is thought to be highly correlated with water intake). A method of estimating water intake, which considers abstract features that are difficult for people to find, is proposed and verified. It is experimentally shown that RMSE of water intake estimated by the proposed method using deep learning is reduced compared with that estimated by conventional methods.",0730-3157;07303157,Electronic:978-1-5386-0367-3; POD:978-1-5386-0368-0,10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.14,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029900,deep learning;estimation;healthcare;water intake,Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Lungs;Machine learning;Medical services;Microphones;Senior citizens,,,,,,,,,,4-8 July 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline.

The app follows closely the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale which is the most commonly used protocol in the clinical study of PD; can be used by patients and their carers at home or in the community; and, requires the user to perform a sequence of iterated movements which are recorded by the phone sensors. This paper discusses how the cloudUPDRS system addresses two key challenges towards meeting essential consistency and efficiency requirements, namely: (i) How to ensure high-quality data collection especially considering the unsupervised nature of the test, in particular, how to achieve firm user adherence to the prescribed movements; and (ii) How to reduce test duration from approximately 25 minutes typically required by an experienced patient, to below 4 minutes, a threshold identified as critical to obtain significant improvements in clinical compliance. To address the former, we combine a bespoke design of the user experience tailored so as to constrain context, with a deep learning approach used to identify failures to follow the movement protocol while at the same time limiting false positives to avoid unnecessary repetition. We address the latter by developing a machine learning approach to personalise assessments by selecting those elements of the UPDRS protocol that most closely match individual symptom profiles and thus offer the highest inferential power hence closely estimating the patent's overall UPRDS score.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4327-9; POD:978-1-5090-4328-6,10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917848,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917848,,Conferences;Diseases;Machine learning;Market research;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Sensors,cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders;smart phones,Medicines-and-Healthcare products Regulatory Agency;UK;UPDRS protocol;active transient noninvasive instrument;class-I medical device;clinical assessment;cloudUPDRS application;data collection;deep learning approach;false positives;machine learning approach;motor symptoms;smart phone data;test duration reduction;unified Parkinson's disease rating scale;user experience,,,,,,,,13-17 March 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

There are numerous compelling applications in healthcare that can benefit from high performance automated decision support systems provided by deep learning technology, but they lack the comprehensive data resources required to apply sophisticated machine learning models. Further, for economic reasons, it is very difficult to justify the creation of large annotated corpora for these applications. Hence, automated annotation techniques become increasingly important. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of using an active learning algorithm to automatically annotate a large EEG corpus. The algorithm is designed to annotate six types of EEG events. Two model training schemes, namely threshold-based and volume-based, are evaluated. In the threshold-based scheme the threshold of confidence scores is optimized in the initial training iteration, whereas for the volume-based scheme only a certain amount of data is preserved after each iteration.

The application of deep-learning to problems in healthcare, however, has gained attention only in recent years, and it's ultimate place at the bedside remains a topic of skeptical discussion. While there is a growing academic interest in the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to clinical problems, many in the clinical community see little incentive to upgrade from simpler methods, such as logistic regression, to deep learning. Logistic regression, after all, provides odds ratios, p-values and confidence intervals that allow for ease of interpretation, while deep nets are often seen as `black-boxes' which are difficult to understand and, as of yet, have not demonstrated performance levels far exceeding their simpler counterparts. If deep learning is to ever take a place at the bedside, it will require studies which (1) showcase the performance of deep-learning methods relative to other approaches and (2) interpret the relationships between network structure, model performance, features and outcomes. We have chosen these two requirements as the goal of this study.

Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening.

Over the past decades, many machine learning approaches have been proposed to identify activities from inertial sensor data for specific applications. Most methods, however, are designed for offline processing rather than processing on the sensor node. In this paper, a human activity recognition technique based on a deep learning methodology is designed to enable accurate and real-time classification for low-power wearable devices. To obtain invariance against changes in sensor orientation, sensor placement, and in sensor acquisition rates, we design a feature generation process that is applied to the spectral domain of the inertial data. Specifically, the proposed method uses sums of temporal convolutions of the transformed input. Accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. A systematic analysis of the feature generation parameters and a comparison of activity recognition computation times on mobile devices and sensor nodes are also presented.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3087-3; POD:978-1-5090-3088-0,10.1109/BSN.2016.7516235,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516235,ActiveMiles;Deep Learning;HAR;Low-Power Devices,Convolution;Data mining;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis,convolution;feature extraction;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement,contextual information;deep learning;feature generation;human activity recognition;inertial sensor data;low-power wearable devices;machine learning;mobile devices;offline processing;resource efficient implementation;sensor acquisition rates;sensor nodes;sensor placement;spectral domain;temporal convolutions,,,,,,,,14-17 June 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, we tackle this problem by using the Multi-integrated Sensor Technology, which comes at a low price. At the same time, we are aiming to address the lightweight learning requirements by investigating Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (FCRBMs), a form of Deep Learning, that has proven to be an efficient and effective machine learning framework.

This research seeks to expand upon the current applications of combining the Android operating system with TensorFlow by providing a visual question answering platform for image analysis. This application, Cognitive Visual Recognition Tracker (CVRT), provides an entry point by which the user can ask questions concerning any image of their choosing, and then receive cumulative metrics over time to better assess any diminishing cognitive ability (i.e. Alzheimer's patients). In this work, recurrent neural networks as well as semantic analysis are leveraged to provide an interactive VQA experience. One of the main objectives of CVRT is for physicians to be able to determine trends from patient data that could either be applicable to the individual patient, or to many patients if an aggregate is formed from many individual datasets. On an individual level, these metrics would provide a way for the physician to monitor daily cognitive capability, whereas on a grander scale, these joint datasets could be used to provide better overall treatment for the disease with the future inclusion of predictive analytics. The final contribution is an interactive metrics platform by which other users can assess the primary user's cognitive capacity based on features of their questioning, and to then provide them with accurate trending or possible remediation plans based on their condition.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4881-6; POD:978-1-5090-4882-3,10.1109/ICHI.2017.65,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031129,Alzheimer's disease and Dementia;Deep Learning;Visual Question Answering,Conferences;Informatics;Medical services,,,,,,,,,,23-26 Aug. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

People often talk about their experiences and opinions on different health-related issues e.g. they write reviews on medications, describe symptoms and ask informal questions about various health concerns. Due to the colloquial nature of the languages used in the social media, it is often difficult for an automated system to accurately interpret them for appropriate clinical understanding. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for medical concept normalization of user-generated texts to map a health condition described in the colloquial language to a medical concept defined in standard clinical terminologies. We use multiple deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with input word embeddings trained on various clinical domain-specific knowledge sources.

In this paper, we substantiate the medical conjecture that OSA directly impacts body parameters such as Instantaneous Heart Rate (IHR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). We then use a deep learning technique called LSTM-RNN (long short-term memory recurrent neural networks) to experimentally prove that OSA severity detection can be solely based on either IHR or SpO2 signals, which can be easily, obtained using off-the-shelf non-intrusive wearable single sensors. The results obtained from LSTM-RNN model shows an area under curve (AUC) of 0.98 associated with very high accuracy on a dataset of more than 16,000 apnea non-apnea minutes.

Hence several current efforts focus on extracting signal from EMRs to prioritize DDIs that need further exploration. To this end, being able to extract explicit mentions of DDIs in free text narratives is an important task. In this paper, we explore recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to detect and classify DDIs from unstructured text using the DDIExtraction dataset from the SemEval 2013 (task 9) shared task. Our methods are in line with those used in other recent deep learning efforts for relation extraction including DDI extraction. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the potential of character-level RNNs (Char-RNNs) for DDI extraction (and relation extraction in general). Furthermore, we explore a simple but effective model bootstrapping method to (a). build model averaging ensembles, (b). derive confidence intervals around mean micro-F scores (MMF), and (c). assess the average behavior of our methods. Without any rule based filtering of negative examples, a popular heuristic used by most earlier efforts, we achieve an MMF of 69.13. By adding simple replicable heuristics to filter negative instances we are able to achieve an MMF of 70.38. Furthermore, our best ensembles produce micro F-scores of 70.81 (without filtering) and 72.13 (with filtering), which are superior to metrics reported in published results.

Currently, such tasks are often carried out by a trained specialist, which makes them expensive, inefficient, and time-consuming. Recent advances in automated video- and multimodal-data-based action and activity recognition have made it possible to reduce the extent of manual intervention required to effectively carry out process supervision tasks. In this paper, we propose algorithms for automated egocentric human action and activity recognition from multimodal data, with a target application of monitoring and assisting a user perform a multi-step medical procedure.

Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redundant information from the pretrained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully-connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization results show that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics.

This paper introduces a fully automated technique for endometrium thickness measurement from three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) images. The algorithm combines the robustness of deep neural networks with the more interpretable level set method for segmentation. We propose a hybrid variational curve propagation model which embeds a deep-learned endometrium probability map in the segmentation energy functional. This solution provides approximately 30% performance improvement over a contemporary supervised learning method on a database of 59 TVUS images and the thickness measurement is found to be within ±2mm of the manual measurement in 87% of the cases.,,Electronic:978-1-5090-1172-8; POD:978-1-5090-1173-5,10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950520,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950520,Endometrium;deep learning;level set;segmentation;ultrasound;uterus,Image segmentation;Level set;Shape;Thickness measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Ultrasonic imaging,biomedical measurement;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;support vector machines;thickness measurement,3D TVUS images;3D transvaginal ultrasound images;automated endometrium assessment;deep learned snake;deep neural networks;deep-learned endometrium probability map;endometrium cancer screening;endometrium thickness measurement;gynecological ultrasound examination;image segmentation;post-menopausal bleeding;supervised learning method;variational curve propagation model,,,,,,,,18-21 April 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Accurate acquisition of fetal standard planes with key anatomical structures is very crucial for substantial biometric measurement and diagnosis. However, the standard plane acquisition is a labor-intensive task and requires operator equipped with a thorough knowledge of fetal anatomy. Therefore, automatic approaches are highly demanded in clinical practice to alleviate the workload and boost the examination efficiency. The automatic detection of standard planes from US videos remains a challenging problem due to the high intraclass and low interclass variations of standard planes, and the relatively low image quality. Unlike previous studies which were specifically designed for individual anatomical standard planes, respectively, we present a general framework for the automatic identification of different standard planes from US videos. Distinct from conventional way that devises hand-crafted visual features for detection, our framework explores in- and between-plane feature learning with a novel composite framework of the convolutional and recurrent neural networks. To further address the issue of limited training data, a multitask learning framework is implemented to exploit common knowledge across detection tasks of distinctive standard planes for the augmentation of feature learning.

The intent of IE is to produce a knowledge base i.e. organize the information in a way that it is useful to people and arrange the information in a semantic way so that algorithms can make certain useful inferences from it. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of IE which finds and classifies the names/entities. Once these Named Entities (NE) are extracted, they can then be indexed and made searchable, relations can be derived, questions can be answered and many more. NER techniques are different for different domains, because of the uniqueness that exists in each of the domains, although the process depends on a number of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing and model building. As an example, NER in the medical domain involves handling of a number of vital tasks such as identification of medical terms, attributes such as negation, severity, identification of relationships between entities and mapping terms in the document to concepts in domain specific ontologies. There is also a heavy dependence on domain specific resources such as medical dictionaries and ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)[34].

Aproper patient similarity measure enables various downstream applications, such as cohort study and treatment comparative effectiveness research. One major carrier for conducting patient similarity research is the Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are usually heterogeneous, longitudinal, and sparse. Though existing studies on learning patient similarity from EHRs have shown being useful in solving real clinical problems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medical interpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume a vector based representation for patients, which typically requires aggregation of medical events over a certain time period. As aconsequence, the temporal information will be lost. In this paper, we propose a patient similarity evaluation framework based on temporal matching of longitudinal patient EHRs. Two efficient methods are presented, unsupervised and supervised, both of which preserve the temporal properties in EHRs.

For most epilepsy patients, the drugs are either not effective or produce severe side-effects. Seizure forecasting systems have the potential to help patients with epilepsy lead more normal lives. Recently multi-center clinical studies showed evidence of premonitory symptoms in 6.2% of 500 patients with epilepsy, and some interviews of epilepsy patients also found that a certain amount of patients felt ""auras"". All these are promising signs suggesting that seizure might be predictable. In this paper, we will study the application of deep learning techniques for seizure prediction with EEG signals. Deep learning methods have been shown to be very effective on exploring the latent structures from continuous signals and they have achieved state-of-the-art performance on speech analysis. One potential requirement for deep learning algorithms to work is a huge training set, which could be difficult for a specific medical problem. Therefore we specifically investigated a transfer learning strategy: we performed the major seizure prediction task on the data from American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge1, and we adopted another 6 publicly available EEG datasets2, which are not directly related to seizure prediction, as auxiliary information to pre-train the deep neural network for getting a good initial point.

We propose a pipeline for object detection and segmentation in the context of volumetric image parsing, solving a two-step learning problem: anatomical pose estimation and boundary delineation. For this task we introduce Marginal Space Deep Learning (MSDL), a novel framework exploiting both the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces and the automated feature design of Deep Learning (DL) network architectures. In the 3D context, the application of deep learning systems is limited by the very high complexity of the parametrization. More specifically 9 parameters are necessary to describe a restricted affine transformation in 3D, resulting in a prohibitive amount of billions of scanning hypotheses. The mechanism of marginal space learning provides excellent run-time performance by learning classifiers in clustered, high-probability regions in spaces of gradually increasing dimensionality. To further increase computational efficiency and robustness, in our system we learn sparse adaptive data sampling patterns that automatically capture the structure of the input. Given the object localization, we propose a DL-based active shape model to estimate the non-rigid object boundary. Experimental results are presented on the aortic valve in ultrasound using an extensive dataset of 2891 volumes from 869 patients, showing significant improvements of up to 45.2% o- er the state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the DL potential to detection and segmentation in full 3D data with parametrized representations.",0278-0062;02780062,,10.1109/TMI.2016.2538802,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426845,Deep learning;image parsing;marginal space learning;sparse representations;three-dimensional (3D) object detection and segmentation,Context;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Robustness;Shape;Three-dimensional displays,biomedical ultrasonics;feature extraction;image classification;image sampling;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;pattern clustering;probability;ultrasonic imaging,3D context;DL-based active shape model;anatomical object detection;anatomical pose estimation;annotated image databases;aortic valve;automated feature design;boundary delineation;clinical workflow;clustered high-probability regions;computational efficiency;deep learning network architectures;deep learning systems;diagnosis;extensive dataset;full 3D data detection;full 3D data segmentation;hierarchical marginal spaces;learning classifiers;machine learning methods;marginal space deep learning;nonrigid object boundary;object localization;object parametrization;parametrized representations;patient stratification;representative image features;restricted affine transformation;run-time performance;scanning high-dimensional parametric spaces;scanning hypotheses;segmentation support;sparse adaptive data sampling patterns;therapy planning;two-step learning problem;ultrasound;volumetric medical image data parsing,,9.0,,46.0,,,20160307.0,May 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Zhou,"Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,20160429.0,2016,35,5.0,1332,1343,"In general image recognition problems, discriminative information often lies in local image patches. For example, most human identity information exists in the image patches containing human faces. The same situation stays in medical images as well. “Bodypart identity” of a transversal slice-which bodypart the slice comes from-is often indicated by local image information, e.g., a cardiac slice and an aorta arch slice are only differentiated by the mediastinum region. In this work, we design a multi-stage deep learning framework for image classification and apply it on bodypart recognition. Specifically, the proposed framework aims at: 1) discover the local regions that are discriminative and non-informative to the image classification problem, and 2) learn a image-level classifier based on these local regions. We achieve these two tasks by the two stages of learning scheme, respectively. In the pre-train stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is learned in a multi-instance learning fashion to extract the most discriminative and and non-informative local patches from the training slices. In the boosting stage, the pre-learned CNN is further boosted by these local patches for image classification. The CNN learned by exploiting the discriminative local appearances becomes more accurate than those learned from global image context. The key hallmark of our method is that it automatically discovers the discriminative and non-informative local patches through multi-instance deep learning. Thus, no manual annotation is required. Our method is validated on a synthetic dataset and a large scale CT dataset.

Different from optimization-based methods, which iteratively optimize the transformation parameters over a scalar-valued metric function representing the quality of the registration, the proposed method exploits the information embedded in the appearances of the digitally reconstructed radiograph and X-ray images, and employs CNN regressors to directly estimate the transformation parameters. An automatic feature extraction step is introduced to calculate 3-D pose-indexed features that are sensitive to the variables to be regressed while robust to other factors. The CNN regressors are then trained for local zones and applied in a hierarchical manner to break down the complex regression task into multiple simpler sub-tasks that can be learned separately. Weight sharing is furthermore employed in the CNN regression model to reduce the memory footprint. The proposed approach has been quantitatively evaluated on 3 potential clinical applications, demonstrating its significant advantage in providing highly accurate real-time 2-D/3-D registration with a significantly enlarged capture range when compared to intensity-based methods.",0278-0062;02780062,,10.1109/TMI.2016.2521800,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393571,2-D/3-D registration;convolutional neural network;deep learning;image guided intervention,Attenuation;Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;X-ray imaging,diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image registration;iterative methods;medical image processing;neural nets;optimisation;regression analysis,3D pose-indexed features;CNN regression approach;CNN regressors;X-ray images;automatic feature extraction step;complex regression task;convolutional neural network regression approach;digitally reconstructed radiograph;formation parameters;intensity-based 2D-3D registration technology;intensity-based methods;iterative optimization;memory footprint;multiple simpler subtasks;optimization-based methods;real-time 2D-3D registration;scalar-valued metric function;transformation parameters,,4.0,,31.0,,,20160126.0,May 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

The experiments were based on a set of 942 pathology reports with human expert annotations as the gold standard. CNN performance was compared against a more conventional term frequency vector space approach. We observed that the deep learning models consistently outperformed the conventional approaches in the class prevalence experiment, resulting in micro and macro-F score increases of up to 0.132 and 0.226 respectively when class labels were well populated. Specifically, the best performing CNN achieved a micro-F score of 0.722 over 12 ICD-O-3 topography codes.

Current deep learning based recognition methods for histology data require collection of large volumes of labeled data in order to train a new neural network when there are changes to the image acquisition procedure. However, it is extremely expensive for pathologists to manually label sufficient volumes of data for each pathology study in a professional manner, which results in limitations in real-world applications. A very simple but effective deep learning method, that introduces the concept of unsupervised domain adaptation to a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), has been proposed in this paper. Inspired by transfer learning, our work assumes that the training data and testing data follow different distributions, and there is an adaptation operation to more accurately estimate the kernels in CNN in feature extraction, in order to enhance performance by transferring knowledge from labeled data in source domain to unlabeled data in target domain. The model has been evaluated using three independent public epithelium-stroma datasets by cross-dataset validations. The experimental results demonstrate that for epithelium-stroma classification, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art deep neural network model, and it also achieves better performance than other existing deep domain adaptation methods.

A challenging task, in this context, is to segment the network of blood vessels. The blood vessel network runs all along the fundal image, varying in density and fineness of structure. Besides, changes in illumination, color and pathology also add to the difficulties in blood vessel segmentation. In this paper, we propose segmentation of blood vessels from fundal images in the deep learning framework, without any pre-processing. A deep convolutional network, consisting of 8 convolutional layers and 3 pooling layers in between, is used to achieve the segmentation. In this work, a Convolutional Neural Network currently in use for semantic image segmentation is customized for blood vessel segmentation by replacing the output layer with a convolutional layer of kernel size 1 × 1 which generates the final segmented image. The output of CNN is a gray scale image and is binarized by thresholding.

In this paper, we propose a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network (SC-CNN) to perform nucleus detection. SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the centers of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches.

Yang,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,20160202.0,2016,35,2.0,550,566,"Computer-aided image analysis of histopathology specimens could potentially provide support for early detection and improved characterization of diseases such as brain tumor, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and breast cancer. Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.",0278-0062;02780062,,10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274740,Deep convolutional neural network;nucleus segmentation;sparse representation,Breast cancer;Computational modeling;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Robustness;Shape;Tumors,cancer;diagnostic radiography;image segmentation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;probability;tumours,automated nucleus segmentation;automatic learning-based framework;automatic morphological feature computation;brain tumor;breast cancer;computer-aided image analysis;deep CNN model;deep convolutional neural network model;diseases;early detection;feature learning characteristic;high level shape prior modeling;histopathology imaging;histopathology specimens;iterative region merging approach;large-scale pathology image datasets;local repulsive deformable model;pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor;probability map;quantitative analysis;robust nucleus segmentation;robust selection-based sparse shape model;staining histopathology images;tissue,,7.0,,83.0,,,20150923.0,Feb. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by 1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and 2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of “Deep Learning” strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 × 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83%.

EEG-based characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages at lower cost in the home. However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which are both uncomfortable and difficult to position. Previous studies of sleep stage scoring that used only frontal electrodes with a hierarchical decision tree motivated this paper, in which we have taken advantage of rectifier neural network for detecting hierarchical features and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for sequential data learning to optimize classification performance with single-channel recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electrooculogram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people (with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical algorithm than is available from existing approaches with vertex or occipital electrode placements.

Based on system identification, an input-output model is established to reveal the relationship between external stimulation and neuronal responses. The model contributes to the implementation of the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm that generates the optimal stimulation waveform to modulate the activities of neuronal nuclei. By analyzing the roles of two critical control parameters within the GPC law, optimal closed-loop control that has the capability of restoring the normal relay reliability of the thalamus with the least stimulation energy expenditure can be achieved. In comparison with open-loop deep brain stimulation and traditional static control schemes, the generalized predictive closed-loop control strategy can optimize the stimulation waveform without requiring any particular knowledge of the physiological properties of the system. This type of closed-loop control strategy generates an adaptive stimulation waveform with low energy expenditure with the potential to improve the treatments for PD.",2162-237X;2162237X,,10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2508599,"10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council¿s Study Abroad Project; 10.13039/501100006606 - Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381666,Basal ganglia (BG) network;Parkinsonian state;energy expenditure;generalized predictive closed-loop control;system identification,Adaptation models;Basal ganglia;Computational modeling;Data models;Modulation;Neurons;Pathology,brain;closed loop systems;diseases;identification;medical disorders;neurophysiology;open loop systems;optimal control;patient treatment;predictive control,GPC law;PD treatment;Parkinson's disease;basal ganglia activity patterns;basal ganglia network;closed-loop modulation;external stimulation;generalized predictive closed-loop control;input-output model;least stimulation energy expenditure;neuronal nuclei;neuronal responses;normal relay reliability;open-loop deep brain stimulation;optimal closed-loop control;optimal stimulation waveform;pathological disorders;physiological properties;static control;system identification;thalamus,,1.0,,,,,20160113.0,Feb. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Yao,"Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory and also with the Clinical Image Processing Service, Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.(email:ling.zhang3@nih.gov)",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,2017,PP,99.0,1,1,"Automation-assisted cervical screening via Pap smear or liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a highly effective cell imaging based cancer detection tool, where cells are partitioned into ”abnormal” and ”normal” categories. However, the success of most traditional classification methods relies on the presence of accurate cell segmentations. Despite sixty years of research in this field, accurate segmentation remains a challenge in the presence of cell clusters and pathologies. Moreover, previous classification methods are only built upon the extraction of hand-crafted features, such as morphology and texture. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a method to directly classify cervical cells – without prior segmentation – based on deep features, using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). First, the ConvNet is pre-trained on a natural image dataset. It is subsequently fine-tuned on a cervical cell dataset consisting of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely centered on the nuclei. In the testing phase, aggregation is used to average the prediction scores of a similar set of image patches. The proposed method is evaluated on both Pap smear and LBC datasets. Results show that our method outperforms previous algorithms in classification accuracy (98.3%), area under the curve (AUC) (0.99) values, and especially specificity (98.3%), when applied to the Herlev benchmark Pap smear dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. Similar superior performances are also achieved on the HEMLBC (H&E stained manual LBC) dataset.

Increased beta oscillations are associated with severe dopaminergic striatal depletion. However, the mechanisms underlying these pathological beta oscillations remain elusive. Inspired by the experimental observation that only subsets of neurons within each nucleus in the BG exhibit oscillatory activities, a computational model of the BG-thalamus neuronal network is proposed, which is characterized by subdivided nuclei within the BG. Using different currents externally applied to the neurons within a given nucleus, neurons behave according to one of the two subgroups, named “-N” and “-P,” where “-N” and “-P” denote the normal and the Parkinsonian states, respectively. The ratio of “-P” to “-N” neurons indicates the degree of the Parkinsonian state. Simulation results show that if “-P” neurons have a high degree of connectivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), they will have a significant downstream effect on the generation of beta oscillations in the globus pallidus. Interestingly, however, the generation of beta oscillations in the STN is independent of the selection of the “-P” neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), despite the reciprocal structure between STN and GPe. This computational model may pave the way to revealing the mechanism of such pathological behaviors in a realistic way that can replicate experimental observations. The simulation results suggest that the STN is more suitable than GPe as a deep brain stimulation target.",2162-237X;2162237X,,10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2688426,Hong Kong Scholars Programs; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7898504,Basal ganglia (BG);Izhikevich model;beta oscillations;parkinsonian state;relay reliability.,Brain models;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Neurons;Oscillators;Pathology,,,,,,,,,20170412.0,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

However, we argue that those hand-crafted features have limited abilities in representing highly abstract information. In this paper, we for the first time develop a deep convolutional neural network for survival analysis (DeepConvSurv) with pathological images. The deep layers in our model could represent more abstract information compared with hand-crafted features from the images. Hence, it will improve the survival prediction performance.

For organs with high anatomical variability (e.g., the pancreas), previous segmentation approaches report low accuracies, compared with well-studied organs, such as the liver or heart. We present an automated bottom-up approach for pancreas segmentation in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. The method generates a hierarchical cascade of information propagation by classifying image patches at different resolutions and cascading (segments) superpixels. The system contains four steps: 1) decomposition of CT slice images into a set of disjoint boundary-preserving superpixels; 2) computation of pancreas class probability maps via dense patch labeling; 3) superpixel classification by pooling both intensity and probability features to form empirical statistics in cascaded random forest frameworks; and 4) simple connectivity based post-processing. Dense image patch labeling is conducted using two methods: efficient random forest classification on image histogram, location and texture features; and more expensive (but more accurate) deep convolutional neural network classification, on larger image windows (i.e., with more spatial contexts). Over-segmented 2-D CT slices by the simple linear iterative clustering approach are adopted through model/parameter calibration and labeled at the superpixel level for positive (pancreas) or negative (non-pancreas or background) classes. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of 80 manually segmented CT volumes, using six-fold cross-validation. Its performance equals or surpasses other state-of-the-art methods (evaluated by “leave-one-patient-out”), with a dice coefficient of 70.7% and Jaccard index of 57.9%. In addition, the computational efficiency has improved significantly, requiring a - ere 6 ~ 8 min per testing case, versus ≥ 10 h for other methods. The segmentation framework using deep patch labeling confidences is also more numerically stable, as reflected in the smaller performance metric standard deviations. Finally, we implement a multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) approach for pancreas segmentation using the same data set. Under six-fold cross-validation, our bottom-up segmentation method significantly outperforms its MALF counterpart: 70.7±13.0% versus 52.51±20.84% in dice coefficients.",1057-7149;10577149,,10.1109/TIP.2016.2624198,10.13039/100000098 - Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727966,Abdominal computed tomography (CT);cascaded random forest;deep convolutional neural networks;dense image patch labeling;pancreas segmentation,Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Labeling;Liver;Pancreas;Shape,biological organs;computerised tomography;image segmentation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;probability,CT slice image decomposition;abdominal computed tomography scans;bottom-up approach;cascaded superpixels;computer-aided diagnosis;deep convolutional neural network classification;deep image patch labeling;dense patch labeling;disjoint boundary-preserving superpixels;image histogram;image location;linear iterative clustering approach;model-parameter calibration;multiatlas label fusion approach;pancreas class probability maps;pancreas segmentation;pathology detection;probability features;quantitative imaging analysis;random forest classification;superpixel classification;surgical assistance;texture features,,,,,,,20161101.0,Jan. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Segmentation of a pathologic AVP (e.g., with low-grade gliomas) poses additional challenges. In this work, we propose a fully automated partitioned shape model segmentation mechanism for AVP steered by multiple MRI sequences and deep learning features. Employing deep learning feature representation, this framework presents a joint partitioned statistical shape model able to deal with healthy and pathological AVP. The deep learning assistance is particularly useful in the poor contrast regions, such as optic tracts and pathological areas. Our main contributions are: 1) a fast and robust shape localization method using conditional space deep learning, 2) a volumetric multiscale curvelet transform-based intensity normalization method for robust statistical model, and 3) optimally partitioned statistical shape and appearance models based on regional shape variations for greater local flexibility.

By leveraging existing CADe systems, coordinates of regions or volumes of interest (ROI or VOI) are generated and function as input for a second tier, which is our focus in this study. In this second stage, we generate 2D (two-dimensional) or 2.5D views via sampling through scale transformations, random translations and rotations.

In testing, the ConvNets assign class (e.g., lesion, pathology) probabilities for a new set of random views that are then averaged to compute a final per-candidate classification probability.

In this paper, we used CNN activations trained by ImageNet to extract features (4096 neurons, 13.3% active). In addition, feature selection, feature pooling, and data augmentation are used in our work. Our system obtained 97.5% accuracy on classification and 84% accuracy on segmentation, demonstrating a significant performance gain over other participating teams.",1520-6149;15206149,Electronic:978-1-4673-6997-8; POD:978-1-4673-6998-5; USB:978-1-4673-6996-1,10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178109,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178109,classification;deep convolutional activation features;deep learning;feature learning;segmentation,Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Support vector machines;Training;Training data;Tumors,brain;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;tumours,CNN activations;ImageNet;MICCAI 2014 Brain Tumor Digital Pathology Challenge;brain tumor histopathology;deep convolutional activation features;features extraction;image classification;image dimensions;image segmentation,,3.0,,23.0,,,,19-24 April 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, we study automatic extraction of feature representation through deep learning (DNN). Furthermore, detailed annotation of objects is often an ambiguous and challenging task. We use multiple instance learning (MIL) framework in classification training with deep learning features. Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from our work: (1) automatic feature learning outperforms manual feature; (2) the unsupervised approach can achieve performance that's close to fully supervised approach (93.56%) vs. (94.52%); and (3) the MIL performance of coarse label (96.30%) outweighs the supervised performance of fine label (95.40%) in supervised deep learning features.",1520-6149;15206149,Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7,10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853873,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853873,deep learning;feature learning;multiple instance learning;supervised;un-supervised,Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Feature extraction;Manuals;Supervised learning;Training;Vectors,feature extraction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing,DNN;HARR features;MIL framework;SIFT features;automatic feature representation extraction;classification training;clinical features;feature representation;manual annotation;medical image analysis;multiple instance learning;supervised deep learning features;unsupervised approach,,14.0,,26.0,,,,4-9 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

New York City, New York, NY, USA","2016 IEEE First International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",20160818.0,2016,,,357,358,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population. Microaneurysms (MAs), due to leakage from retina blood vessels, are the early signs of DR. However, automated MA detection is complicated because of the small size of MA lesions and the low contrast between the lesion and its retinal background. Recently deep learning (DL) strategies have been used for automatic feature extraction and classification problems, especially for image analysis. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a DL strategy, is presented for MA detection in fundus images. Small image patches are generated from the original fundus images. The SSAE learns high-level features from pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of MA. The high-level features learned by SSAE are fed into a classifier to categorize each image patch as MA or non-MA. The public benchmark DIARETDB is utilized to provide the training/testing data and ground truth. Among the 89 images, totally 2182 image patches with MA lesions, serve as positive data, and another 6230 image patches without MA lesions are generated by a randomly sliding window operation, to serve as negative data. Without any blood vessel removal or complicated preprocessing operations, SSAE learned directly from the raw image patches, and automatically extracted the distinguishing features to classify the patches using Softmax Classifier. By employing the fine-tuning operation, an improved F-measure 91.3% and an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) 96.2% were achieved using 10-fold cross-validation.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-0943-5; POD:978-1-5090-0944-2,10.1109/CHASE.2016.12,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545864,automated microaneurysm detection;deep learning;diabetic retinopathy;feature representation;stacked sparse autoencoder,Biomedical image processing;Conferences;Feature extraction;Lesions;Machine learning,blood vessels;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing,10-fold cross-validation;DIARETDB public benchmark;DR;F-measure;SSAE;automated MA detection;automatic feature extraction;blindness;classification problems;deep learning method;diabetic retinopathy;fine-tuning operation;fundus images;image analysis;microaneurysm detection;microaneurysms;randomly sliding window operation;retina blood vessels;softmax classifier;stacked sparse autoencoder;working-age population,,1.0,,,,,,27-29 June 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Deep Learning models have recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art in several fields, since they can learn features with multiple levels of abstraction from the data itself. However, these methods can easily fall into overfitting, since a huge number of parameters must be learned. Having bigger datasets may act as regularization and lead to better models. Yet, acquiring and manually annotating images, especially in the medical field, can be a long and costly procedure. Hence, when using regular datasets, people heavily need to apply artificial data augmentation. In this work, we use a fully convolutional neural network capable of reaching the state-of-the-art.

In order to make reliable judgments for clinical usage, accurate and robust segmentation methods are needed. Due to the high complexity of biological vasculature trees, manual identification is often too time-consuming and tedious to be used in practice. To design an automated and computerized method, a major challenge is that the appearance of vasculatures in medical images has great variance across modalities and subjects. Therefore, most existing approaches are specially designed for a particular task, lacking the flexibility to be adapted to other circumstances. In this paper, we present a generic approach for vascular structure identification from medical images, which can be used for multiple purposes robustly. The proposed method uses the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the appearance features of the target. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based nearest neighbor search is then utilized to estimate the local structure distribution, which is further incorporated within the generalized probabilistic tracking framework to extract the entire connected tree.

However, most work to date has investigated the binary classification problem for predicting the onset of one chronic disease, but little attention has been given to assessing risk of developing comorbidities that are major causes of morbidity and mortality. For example, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease frequently accompany congestive heart failure. This paper is motivated by the problem of predicting comorbid diseases and aims to answer the following question: can we predict the comorbid risk using a patient's medical history? We propose a new predictive learning framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), that represents EHRs as graphs with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, and medication), and then develop a novel deep learning methodology for risk prediction of multiple comorbid diseases. The main innovation of the framework is that it defines the distance between the heterogeneous attributes of the graph representation extracted from the EHR and develops an appropriate learning infrastructure that is a composition of sparse convolutional layers and local pooling steps that match with the local structure of the space of the heterogeneous attributes. As a result, the new method is capable of capturing features about the relationships between heterogeneous attributes of the graphs.

Liu,"College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China 310008 (e-mail: zhengxing.h@gmail.com)",IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,2017,PP,99.0,1,1,"Objective: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as a common and severe cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death and the principal cause of serious long-term disability globally. Clinical risk prediction of ACS is important for early intervention and treatment. Existing ACS risk scoring models are based mainly on a small set of hand-picked risk factors and often dichotomize predictive variables to simplify the score calculation [1-3]. Methods: This study develops a regularized stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) model to stratify clinical risks of ACS patients from a large volume of electronic health records (EHR). To capture characteristics of patients at similar risk levels, and preserve the discriminating information across different risk levels, two constraints are added on SDAE to make the reconstructed feature representations contain more risk information of patients, which contribute to a better clinical risk prediction result. Results: We validate our approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 3,464 ACS patient samples. The performance of our approach for predicting ACS risk remains robust and reaches 0.868 and 0.73 in terms of both AUC and Accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: The obtained results show that the proposed approach achieves a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in dealing with the clinical risk prediction problem. In addition, our approach can extract informative risk factors of ACS via a reconstructive learning strategy. Some of these extracted risk factors are not only consistent with existing medical domain knowledge, but also contain suggestive hypotheses that could be validated by further investigations in the medical domain.",0018-9294;00189294,,10.1109/TBME.2017.2731158,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990180,Acute coronary syndrome;Clinical risk prediction;Deep learning;Electronic Health Record;Stacked denoising auto-encoder,,,,,,,,,,20170724.0,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

However, understanding the mechanism through which the transcription factors regulate the gene expression is a challenging task. This is primarily hindered by the low specificity in identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The emergence of the ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) method enables the detection of TFBS at single nucleotide sensitivity, providing us an opportunity to study the detailed mechanisms of TF regulation. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of computational tools that can also provide single base pair (bp) resolution prediction of TFBS.

Gene expression profiling is being widely used in cancer studies to discover informative biomarkers that aid predict different clinical endpoint prediction. We use multiple modalities of data derived from RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) to predict survival of cancer patients. Despite the wealth of information available in expression profiles of cancer tumors, fulfilling the aforementioned objective remains a big challenge, for the most part, due to the paucity of data samples compared to the high dimension of the expression profiles. As such, analysis of transcriptomic data modalities calls for state-of-the-art big-data analytics techniques that can maximally use all the available data to discover the relevant information hidden within a significant amount of noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that predicts cancer patients' survival by exploiting the structure of the input (manifold learning) and by leveraging the unlabeled samples using Laplacian support vector machines, a graph-based semi supervised learning (GSSL) paradigm. We show that under certain circumstances, no single modality per se will result in the best accuracy and by fusing different models together via a stacked generalization strategy, we may boost the accuracy synergistically. We apply our approach to two cancer datasets and present promising results.

Thus, a practical challenge is to determine what features are appropriate for specific tasks. For example, in the study of gene expression patterns in Drosophila, texture features were particularly effective for determining the developmental stages from in situ hybridization images. Such image representation is however not suitable for controlled vocabulary term annotation. Here, we developed feature extraction methods to generate hierarchical representations for ISH images. Our approach is based on the deep convolutional neural networks that can act on image pixels directly. To make the extracted features generic, the models were trained using a natural image set with millions of labeled examples. These models were transferred to the ISH image domain. To account for the differences between the source and target domains, we proposed a partial transfer learning scheme in which only part of the source model is transferred. We employed multi-task learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained models with labeled ISH images. Results showed that feature representations computed by deep models based on transfer and multi-task learning significantly outperformed other methods for annotating gene expression patterns at different stage ranges.",,,10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2573280,10.13039/100000002 - National Institutes of Health; 10.13039/100000145 - Division of Information and Intelligent Systems; 10.13039/100000153 - Division of Biological Infrastructure; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480825,Deep learning;bioinformatics;image analysis;multi-task learning;transfer learning,Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Gene expression;Training,,,,,,,,,20160530.0,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

It's premise that different representations can interweave and ensnare most of the elucidative genes that are responsible for variations in images, be it rigid, affine or projective. Hence researches give at most attention in hand-engineering features that capture these variations. But problem is, we need subtle domain knowledge to do that. Thereby making researchers elude epitome of representations. Hence learning algorithms never reach their full potential. In recent times there has been a shift from hand-crafting features to representation learning. The resulting features are not only optimal but also generic as in they can be used as off the shelf features for visual recognition tasks. In this paper we design and experiment with a basic deep convolution neural nets for learning generic vision features with an variant of convolving kernels.

In these settings, the relations between instances and labels are usually ambiguous. In contrast, multi-task learning focuses on the output space in which an input sample is associated with multiple labels. In real world, a sample may be associated with multiple labels that are derived from observing multiple aspects of the problem. Thus many real world applications are naturally formulated as multi-instance multi-task (MIMT) problems. A common approach to MIMT is to solve it task-by-task independently under the multi-instance learning framework. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance in single-instance single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN deals with multi-instance multi-label tasks still remains an open problem. This is mainly due to the complex multiple-to-multiple relations between the input and output space. In this work, we propose a deep leaning model, known as multi-instance multi-task convolutional neural networks (MIMT-CNN), where a number of images representing a multi-task problem is taken as the inputs. Then a shared sub-CNN is connected with each input image to form instance representations. Those sub-CNN outputs are subsequently aggregated as inputs to additional convolutional layers and full connection layers to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. This CNN model, through transfer learning from other domains, enables transfer of prior knowledge at image level learned from large single-label single-task data sets. The bag level representations in this model are hierarchically abstracted by multiple layers from instance level representations.

Zeng,"Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P. R. China",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,20150805.0,2015,12,4.0,928,937,"Identification of cancer subtypes plays an important role in revealing useful insights into disease pathogenesis and advancing personalized therapy. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personali- ed cancer therapy.",1545-5963;15455963,,10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729,National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977954,Multi-platform cancer data analysis;clinical data;genomic data;identification of cancer subtypes;multimodal deep belief network;restricted Boltzmann machine,Bioinformatics;Cancer;Computational biology;DNA;Data analysis;Data models;Genomics,RNA;belief networks;cancer;data analysis;feature extraction;genetics;genomics;medical computing;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;tumours;unsupervised learning,DNA methylation;advancing personalized therapy;cancer data analysis;cancer pathogenesis;cancer patient clustering;cancer subtype identification;complex cross-modality correlations;contrastive divergence;cross-modality correlations;disease pathogenesis;gene expression;high-throughput sequencing technologies;input modality;integrative clustering approaches;integrative data analysis;integrative data analysis approach;intramodality correlations;intrinsic statistical properties;joint latent model;key genes;latent feature extraction;machine learning model;miR-29a;miRNA expression;multimodal DBN based data analysis;multimodal DBN model;multimodal deep belief network;multimodal deep learning approach;multiplatform cancer data;multiplatform genomic data;multiple input modalities;ovarian cancer patients;personalized cancer therapy;practical learning algorithm;tumor samples;unsupervised manner,Computational Biology;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Machine Learning;MicroRNAs;Neoplasms,9.0,,30.0,,,20141205.0,July-Aug. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes.

As a result, a huge amount of omics data measured from different genetic and epigenetic events are available. For example, the amount of data at The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) alone exceeds 2.5 peta byte as of October 2016. Unfortunately, the dimensions of omics data is huge, typically tens to hundreds or even millions of thousands while the number of samples are limited typically a few to thousands. Thus mining genetic and epigenetic data measured in different phenotype conditions is a very challenging problem, that is, small data sets on extremely high dimensions. Furthermore, all genetic and epigenetic events are inter-related. Thus it is necessary to perform integrated analysis of omics data sets of different types, which is even more challenging. To address these technical challenges, the bioinformatics community has used virtually all known network based analysis techniques, including recently developed deep neural networks. My group has been trying the network based integrated analysis of omics data at three different levels.

A non-problem related feature contains little information and has little influence on the data distribution. By permuting the feature and calculating the data distribution difference, how much information the feature contains could be measured. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method (EUFSPR), which combines the ensemble technique, clustering, permutation and data distribution evaluation techniques to measure the feature importance. Clustering is adopted to get the sample groups and the data distribution is evaluated by the overlapping areas.

In this paper, a new approach to designing neural networks is presented. The structure of the proposed NN is not strictly defined (each neuron may receive input from any other neuron). Instead, the initial network structure can be randomly generated, and traditional methods of training, such as back-propagation, are replaced or augmented by a genetic algorithm (GA). The weighting of each neuron input is encoded genetically to serve as the genes for the GA. By means of the training data provided to the supervised network, the contribution of each neuron in creating a desired output serves as a selection function. Each of the neurons is then modified to store and recall past weightings for possible future use.

The loss of ambulation (LoA) is a functional milestone of DMD progression and the age at LoA is often used as an indication of disease severity. But as age at LoA is not always available, such as when patients remain ambulant at study end, its use has been limited. In this paper, we report machine learning approaches to predict age at LoA based on clinical measures of muscular strength and motor function, and validate the algorithms using the CINRG dataset. With extensive experiments and rigorous statistical analysis, we found that (1) the utilization of multiple clinical features yields better prediction than using any of the single measures, and (2) the prediction based on Lasso is more accurate than other multivariate analytical approaches such as ordinary least squares and ridge regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide point predictions for age at LoA in DMD using clinical phenotypic measures. Importantly, we find that not all clinical measures contribute to the prediction. Age at the last visit (before LoA), velocity of walking 10 meters, and velocity of climbing 4 steps are selected as important predictors by Lasso. The usefulness of the prediction model is illustrated with evidence that the association between a well-known modifier of DMD severity and age at LoA has better power when the predicted values are utilized.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-7088-9; POD:978-1-4799-7089-6; USB:978-1-4799-7087-2,10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032343,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032343,,Accuracy;Data models;Diseases;Drugs;Loss measurement;Numerical models;Predictive models,diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders;muscle;statistical analysis,DMD;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;LoA;age prediction;clinical phenotypic measure;loss of ambulation;machine learning;single-gene lethal disorder;statistical analysis,,0.0,,8.0,,,,3-5 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes.

In this paper, by constructing a multilayer restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) deep network, we use the genomic data (i.e., SNP data) for unsupervised feature learning and disease diagnosis of schizophrenia. In order to obtain some more accurate diagnosis results by RBMs, firstly, we transform the SNP data into binary sequences, and then by training the multi-layer RBMs deep network on unlabeled data, the multi-level abstract features of the genomic data are obtained and stored in the network. Finally, by adding a linear classifier to the top of the multi-layer RBMs deep network, the classification results on the testing data are gained. The results show that the average performance of this method is better than that of other methods, e.g., SVM (including linear SVM as well as SVM with multilayer perceptron kernel), sparse representations based classifier and k-nearest neighbors method.

However, AI models still fail to match humans in high-level vision tasks due to the lack of capacities for deeper reasoning. Recently the new task of visual question answering (QA) has been proposed to evaluate a model's capacity for deep image understanding. Previous works have established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images. However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding.

We study the visual QA tasks in a grounded setting with a large collection of 7W multiple-choice QA pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate human performance and several baseline models on the QA tasks.

189,High class-imbalance in pre-miRNA prediction: a novel approach based on deepSOM,G. Stegmayer; C. Yones; L. Kamenetzky; D. H. Milone,"Georgina Stegmayer is with the Research Institute for Signals, Systems and Computational Intelligence (sinc(i)), FICH-UNL, CONICET, Argentina (e-mail: gstegmayer@sinc.unl.edu.ar).",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,,2016,PP,99.0,1,1,"The computational prediction of novel microRNA within a full genome involves identifying sequences having the highest chance of being a miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). These sequences are usually named candidates to miRNA. The well-known pre-miRNAs are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates to miRNA that have to be analyzed, which makes this task a high classimbalance classification problem. The classical way of approaching it has been training a binary classifier in a supervised manner, using well-known pre-miRNAs as positive class and artificially defining the negative class. However, although the selection of positive labeled examples is straightforward, it is very difficult to build a set of negative examples in order to obtain a good set of training samples for a supervised method. In this work, we propose a novel and effective way of approaching this problem using machine learning, without the definition of negative examples. The proposal is based on clustering unlabeled sequences of a genome together with well-known miRNA precursors for the organism under study, which allows for the quick identification of the best candidates to miRNA as those sequences clustered with known precursors. Furthermore, we propose a deep model to overcome the problem of having very few positive class labels. They are always maintained in the deep levels as positive class while less likely pre-miRNA sequences are filtered level after level. Our approach has been compared with other methods for pre-miRNAs prediction in several species, showing effective predictivity of novel miRNAs. Additionally, we will show that our approach has a lower training time and allows for a better graphical navegability and interpretation of the results.

However, experimentally identifying compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is generally expensive and time-consuming, computational approaches are thus introduced. Among these, machine-learning based methods have achieved a considerable success. However, due to the nonlinear and imbalanced nature of biological data, many machine learning approaches have their own limitations. Recently, deep learning techniques show advantages over many state-of-the-art machine learning methods in many applications. In this study, we aim at improving the performance of CPI prediction based on deep learning, and propose a method called DL-CPI (the abbreviation of Deep Learning for Compound-Protein Interactions prediction), which employs deep neural network (DNN) to effectively learn the representations of compound-protein pairs. Extensive experiments show that DL-CPI can learn useful features of compound-protein pairs by a layerwise abstraction, and thus achieves better prediction performance than existing methods on both balanced and imbalanced datasets.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-6799-8; POD:978-1-4673-6800-1,10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359651,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359651,Compound-protein interaction;Deep learning;Deep neural network (DNN),Bioinformatics;Genomics;Radio frequency;Training,biology computing;drugs;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;proteins,DL-CPI;compound-protein interaction prediction;deep learning techniques;deep neural network;drug discovery;layerwise abstraction;machine-learning;network pharmacology,,1.0,,22.0,,,,9-12 Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

192,Multi-Layer and Recursive Neural Networks for Metagenomic Classification,G. Ditzler; R. Polikar; G. Rosen,"Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia",IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience,20150828.0,2015,14,6.0,608,616,"Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in deep learning with neural networks, has made a profound impact on fields such as natural language processing, image classification, and language modeling; however, feasibility and potential benefits of the approaches to metagenomic data analysis has been largely under-explored. Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.",1536-1241;15361241,,10.1109/TNB.2015.2461219,Department of Energy; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219432,Comparative metagenomics;metagenomics;microbiome;neural networks,Feature extraction;Machine learning;Nanobioscience;Neural networks;Organisms;Training;Vegetation,DNA;genomics;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;molecular biophysics;multilayer perceptrons;natural language processing;neurophysiology,classification accuracy;data structure;deep belief network;deep learning methods;generalization performance;hierarchical representations;image classification;language modeling;machine learning;machine learning community;metagenomic classification;metagenomic data analysis;metagenomic literature;multilayer perceptron;multilayer-recursive neural networks;natural language processing;neural networks;nonlinear feature representations;prediction algorithm;predictive metagenomic analysis;unsupervised fashion,Algorithms;Metagenomics;Microbiota;Neural Networks (Computer),4.0,,44.0,,,20150824.0,Sept. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
