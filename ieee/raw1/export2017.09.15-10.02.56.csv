Since CNN-type filters have only spatially local interconnections and the number of connections between neurons is relatively low, the required computation in the learning phase is a reasonable amount. However, the output/input behavior is restrictive. The proposed CNN filters are designed as complex-coefficient filters which can improve the output SNR and process the 2D analytic signals of input images. The filter parameters are determined by applying a complex domain backpropagation algorithm. Through several simulations, it is shown that the proposed filters are robust and noise-tolerant for medical images","","POD:0-7803-7078-3","10.1109/NAFIPS.2001.943797","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943797","","Backpropagation algorithms;Biomedical imaging;Cellular neural networks;Filters;Image analysis;Image enhancement;Neurons;Signal analysis;Signal design;Signal processing","backpropagation;cellular neural nets;filtering theory;image enhancement;medical image processing","2D analytic signal processing;complex domain backpropagation algorithm;complex weighting factors;complex-coefficient filters;complex-valued cellular neural network filters;computational requirements;filter parameters;learning phase;medical image enhancement;noise tolerance;output/input behavior;robustness;signal-to-noise ratio;simulations;spatially local neuron interconnections","","0","","6","","","","25-28 July 2001","25 Jul 2001-28 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People often talk about their experiences and opinions on different health-related issues e.g. they write reviews on medications, describe symptoms and ask informal questions about various health concerns. Due to the colloquial nature of the languages used in the social media, it is often difficult for an automated system to accurately interpret them for appropriate clinical understanding. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for medical concept normalization of user-generated texts to map a health condition described in the colloquial language to a medical concept defined in standard clinical terminologies. We use multiple deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with input word embeddings trained on various clinical domain-specific knowledge sources. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed models can achieve up to 21.28% accuracy improvements over the existing models when we use the combination of all knowledge sources to learn neural embeddings.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4881-6; POD:978-1-5090-4882-3","10.1109/ICHI.2017.59","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031195","deep learning;medical concept normalization;social media","Drugs;Hair;Hidden Markov models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pain;Recurrent neural networks;Social network services","","","","","","","","","","23-26 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common method to solve this problem is employing patches extracted from every pixel of the entire image as train samples. But classifying every pixel in the image is time-consuming, which is not appropriate in practical medical application. This paper proposed a fast segmentation algorithm based on trained network model to reduce test time. Transforming the fully-connected layer of trained network into convolutional layer is used as the test network and the entire image is the input of test network. However, due to the convolutional and pooling operation of CNN, some pixel classification results are missed. To obtain corresponding segmentation, different size of original image are cropped as the input of test network, and interpolation is taken to supply the final image segmentation, according to the offset rule of the input images. The numerical simulation experiments indicated that the proposed algorithm show prominent performance in segmentation time and remain unchanged in the final segmentation result compared with initial train network architecture.","","DVD:978-1-5090-6236-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-6238-6; POD:978-1-5090-6239-3","10.1109/ICIVC.2017.7984573","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7984573","convolutional neural network;medical image segmentation;patch sharing","Art;Convolution;Image segmentation;Knowledge engineering;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging","convolution;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","CNNs;convolutional layer;fast medical image segmentation;image cropping;medical data;patch extraction;patch sharing;pixel classification;trained network model","","","","","","","","2-4 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel unified deep learning model for improving protein tertiary structure prediction. The core contribution of this work is the group of deep convolution neural networks (deep CNNs) that can directly learn the high-level relational features from a pair of the query and target protein sequences. The deep CNN can learn high-level relational features from the pairwise protein sequences in a hierarchy by progressively integrating convergent protein property representations from lower levels. Multiple deep CNNs are designed to achieve robust protein structure similarities from different aspects. These relational features are fully connected to the top two Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMS) layer to further extract global relational features, which significantly improve the protein structure prediction. Experiments conducted on a well-known benchmark, SCOPe dataset, show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various statistical measurements.

To address this problem, we present a two-stage task-oriented deep learning method to detect large-scale anatomical landmarks simultaneously in real time, using limited training data. Specifically, our method consists of two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), with each focusing on one specific task. Specifically, to alleviate the problem of limited training data, in the first stage, we propose a CNN based regression model using millions of image patches as input, aiming to learn inherent associations between local image patches and target anatomical landmarks. To further model the correlations among image patches, in the second stage, we develop another CNN model, which includes a) a fully convolutional network that shares the same architecture and network weights as the CNN used in the first stage and also b) several extra layers to jointly predict coordinates of multiple anatomical landmarks. Importantly, our method can jointly detect large-scale (e.g., thousands of) landmarks in real time. We have conducted various experiments for detecting 1200 brain landmarks from the 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 700 subjects, and also 7 prostate landmarks from the 3D computed tomography images of 73 subjects.

It is a significant and challenging task to quickly locate the exact positions of lung nodules. Extensive work has been done by researchers around this domain for approximately two decades. However, previous computer aided detection (CADe) schemes are mostly intricate and time-consuming since they may require more image processing modules, such as the computed tomography (CT) image transformation, the lung nodule segmentation and the feature extraction, to construct a whole CADe system. It is difficult for those schemes to process and analyze enormous data when the medical images continue to increase. Besides, some state of the art deep learning schemes may be strict in the standard of database. This study proposes an effective lung nodule detection scheme based on multi-group patches cut out from the lung images, which are enhanced by the Frangi filter. Through combining two groups of images, a four-channel convolution neural networks (CNN) model is designed to learn the knowledge of radiologists for detecting nodules of four levels. This CADe scheme can acquire the sensitivity of 80.06% with 4.7 false positives per scan and the sensitivity of 94% with 15.1 false positives per scan. The results demonstrate that the multi-group patch-based learning system is efficient to improve the performance of lung nodule detection and greatly reduce the false positives under a huge amount of image data.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2017.2725903","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7981333","Frangi filter;computed tomography (CT) images;computer aided detection (CADe);deep learning network;lung nodule detection","Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Computed tomography;Databases;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Lungs","","","","","","","","","20170714","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The system leverages both a priori knowledge about lung nodules and confounding anatomical structures and data-driven machine-learned features and classifier. Specifically, we generate nodule candidates using a local geometric-model-based filter and further reduce the structure variability by estimating the local orientation. The nodule candidates in the form of 3D cubes are fed into a deep 3D convolutional neural network that is trained to differentiate nodule and non-nodule inputs. We use data augmentation techniques to generate a large number of training examples and apply regularization to avoid overfitting.

However, raw data, e.g., spatial context information from 3D CT images, even without annotation, may contain rich useful information. In this paper, we exploit spatial context information as a source of supervision to solve discrimination tasks for fine-grained body part recognition with conventional 3D CT and MR volumes. The proposed pipeline consists of two steps: 1) pre-train a convolutional network for an auxiliary task of 2D slices ordering in a self-supervised manner; 2) transfer and fine-tune the pre-trained network for fine-grained body part recognition. Without any use of human annotation in the first stage, the pre-trained network can still outperform CNN trained from scratch on CT as well as M-R data. Moreover, by comparing with pre-trained CNN from ImageNet, we discover that the distance between source and target tasks plays a crucial role in transfer learning. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve high accuracy with a slice location estimation error of only a few slices on CT and MR data. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt studying the problem of robust body part recognition at a continuous level.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1172-8; POD:978-1-5090-1173-5","10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950587","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950587","Body Part Recognition;Self Supervised Learning;Slice Ordering","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Context;Image recognition;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Two dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","3D CT;MR volumes;fine-grained body part recognition;self supervised deep representation learning;spatial context information;transfer learning","","","","","","","","18-21 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this paper is to effectively address the challenges in this task and therefore to accurately discriminate the true nodules from a large number of candidates. Methods: We propose a novel method employing three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for false positive reduction in automated pulmonary nodule detection from volumetric computed tomography (CT) scans. Compared with its 2-D counterparts, the 3-D CNNs can encode richer spatial information and extract more representative features via their hierarchical architecture trained with 3-D samples. More importantly, we further propose a simple yet effective strategy to encode multilevel contextual information to meet the challenges coming with the large variations and hard mimics of pulmonary nodules. Results: The proposed framework has been extensively validated in the LUNA16 challenge held in conjunction with ISBI 2016, where we achieved the highest competition performance metric (CPM) score in the false positive reduction track. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of integrating multilevel contextual information into 3-D CNN framework for automated pulmonary nodule detection in volumetric CT data.

Due to the difficulty of modeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing methods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image noise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, here we combine the autoencoder, deconvolution network, and shortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging.

However, manual quality control is a labor intensive process and often impractical in a clinical setting. To improve the efficiency of examination and alleviate the measurement error caused by improper US scanning operation and slice selection, a computerized fetal US image quality assessment (FUIQA) scheme is proposed to assist the implementation of US image quality control in the clinical obstetric examination. The proposed FUIQA is realized with two deep convolutional neural network models, which are denoted as L-CNN and C-CNN, respectively. The L-CNN aims to find the region of interest (ROI) of the fetal abdominal region in the US image. Based on the ROI found by the L-CNN, the C-CNN evaluates the image quality by assessing the goodness of depiction for the key structures of stomach bubble and umbilical vein. To further boost the performance of the L-CNN, we augment the input sources of the neural network with the local phase features along with the original US data. It will be shown that the heterogeneous input sources will help to improve the performance of the L-CNN. The performance of the proposed FUIQA is compared with the subjective image quality evaluation results from three medical doctors. With comprehensive experiments, it will be illustrated that the computerized assessment with our FUIQA scheme can be comparable to the subjective ratings from medical doctors.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2017.2671898","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of SZU; Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University); Shenzhen Basic Research Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875138","Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN);fetal ultrasound (US);local phase;quality control","Biomedical imaging;Biomedical measurement;Image quality;Quality assessment;Quality control;Standards;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical ultrasonics;feedforward neural nets;medical image processing;obstetrics;ultrasonic imaging","C-CNN;FUIQA;L-CNN;ROI;clinical obstetric examination;deep convolutional neural network;fetal US image quality assessment;fetal ultrasound image quality assessment;region of interest","","","","","","","20170309","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the content and semantics of an image can vary depending on its modality and as such the identification of image modality is an important preliminary step. The key challenge for automatically classifying the modality of a medical image is due to the visual characteristics of different modalities: some are visually distinct while others may have only subtle differences. This challenge is compounded by variations in the appearance of images based on the diseases depicted and a lack of sufficient training data for some modalities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for classifying medical images that uses an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. CNNs are a state-of-the-art image classification technique that learns the optimal image features for a given classification task. We hypothesise that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic image representation and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable higher quality features to be extracted. Our method develops a new feature extractor by fine-tuning CNNs that have been initialized on a large dataset of natural images. The fine-tuning process leverages the generic image features from natural images that are fundamental for all images and optimizes them for the variety of medical imaging modalities. These features are used to train numerous multiclass classifiers whose posterior probabilities are fused to predict the modalities of unseen images. Our experiments on the ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset (30 modalities; 6776 training images, and 4166 test images) show that our ensemble of fine-tuned CNNs achieves a higher accuracy than established CNNs. Our ensemble also achieves a higher accuracy than - ethods in the literature evaluated on the same benchmark dataset and is only overtaken by those methods that source additional training data.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635663","10.13039/100000163 - ARC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7769199","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;ensembles;fine-tuning;image classification","Biomedical imaging;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Informatics;Neural networks;Training;Training data","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;medical image processing;neural nets;probability","ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset;feature extraction;fine-tuned convolutional neural networks;image features;medical image classification;natural image dataset;posterior probability;semantic image representation","","","","","","","20161205","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, unsupervised image categorization (i.e., without the ground-truth labeling) is much less investigated, yet critically important and difficult when annotations are extremely hard to obtain in the conventional way of ""Google Search"" and crowd sourcing. We address this problem by presenting a looped deep pseudo-task optimization (LDPO) framework for joint mining of deep CNN features and image labels. Our method is conceptually simple and rests upon the hypothesized ""convergence"" of better labels leading to better trained CNN models which in turn feed more discriminative image representations to facilitate more meaningful clusters/labels. Our proposed method is validated in tackling two important applications: 1) Large-scale medical image annotation has always been a prohibitively expensive and easily-biased task even for well-trained radiologists. Significantly better image categorization results are achieved via our proposed approach compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. 2) Unsupervised scene recognition on representative and publicly available datasets with our proposed technique is examined. The LDPO achieves excellent quantitative scene classification results. On the MIT indoor scene dataset, it attains a clustering accuracy of 75:3%, compared to the state-of-the-art supervised classification accuracy of 81:0% (when both are based on the VGG-VD model).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4822-9; POD:978-1-5090-4823-6","10.1109/WACV.2017.116","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926699","","Biomedical imaging;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Image representation;Optimization;Radiology","","","","","","","","","","24-31 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Obtaining labels can be an expensive process, especially in medical imaging applications where a qualified expert may be needed to carefully analyze images and annotate them. This constrains the amount of labeled data available. This study explores the possibility of incorporating labeling behavior (viz., labeling latency) in a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) framework in order to improve its performance in the presence of limited labeled data. The problem of ‚Äúspot‚Äù detection in MRI scans is considered in this work. In this two-class problem, (a) labeling behavior is available only during the training phase unlike traditional features that are available both during training and testing; and (b) the labeling behavior is associated with only one class (the positive samples) unlike other side information that is available for all classes. To address these issues, a new CNN architecture referred to as L-CNN is designed. The proposed method utilizes the labeling behavior of the expert to cluster the labeled data into multiple categories; a source CNN is then trained to distinguish between these categories. Next, a transfer learning paradigm is used where a target CNN is initialized using this source CNN and its weights updated with the limited labeled data that is available. Experimental results on an existing MRI database show that the proposed L-CNN performs better than a conventional CNN and, further, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, thereby establishing a new baseline for ‚Äúspot‚Äù detection in MRI.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899955","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899955","","Biomedical imaging;Computer architecture;Labeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Microprocessors;Testing;Training","biomedical MRI;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","L-CNN;MRI scans;labeling behavior;supervised convolutional neural network learning framework;supervised learning system;transfer learning paradigm;two-class problem","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bridge this gap, we exploit three multi-task learning (MTL) schemes to leverage heterogeneous computational features derived from deep learning models of stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as hand-crafted Haar-like and HoG features, for the description of 9 semantic features for lung nodules in CT images. We regard that there may exist relations among the semantic features of ‚Äúspiculation‚Äù, ‚Äútexture‚Äù, ‚Äúmargin‚Äù, etc., that can be explored with the MTL. The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) data is adopted in this study for the rich annotation resources. The LIDC nodules were quantitatively scored w.r.t. 9 semantic features from 12 radiologists of several institutes in U.S.A. By treating each semantic feature as an individual task, the MTL schemes select and map the heterogeneous computational features toward the radiologists' ratings with cross validation evaluation schemes on the randomly selected 2400 nodules from the LIDC dataset. The experimental results suggest that the predicted semantic scores from the three MTL schemes are closer to the radiologists' ratings than the scores from single-task LASSO and elastic net regression methods. The proposed semantic attribute scoring scheme may provide richer quantitative assessments of nodules for better support of diagnostic decision and management.

Specifically for computed tomography (CT) images, quantitative image assessment can allow for benchmarking image processing methods and optimization of image acquisition parameters. In this work, large volumes of CT images from phantoms and patients are analyzed using 3 data models that vary in their implementation time complexities. The goal here is to identify the optimal method that scales across data set variabilities for predictive modeling of CT image quality (CTIQ). The first two models rely on spatial segmentation of regions-of-interest (ROIs) and estimate CTIQs in terms of segmented pixel variabilities. The third, convolutional neural network (CNN) model relies on error back-propagation from the training set of images to learn the regions indicative of CTIQ. We observe that for 70/30 data split, the average multi-class classification accuracies for CTIQ prediction using the 3 data models range from 73.6-100% and 50-100% for the phantom and patient CT images, respectively. Using variance of pixels within the segmented ROIs as a CTIQ classification parameter, the spatial segmentation data models are found to be more generalizable that the CNN model. However, the CNN model is found to be more suitable for CT image texture classification in the absence of structural variabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that spatial ROI segmentation data models are consistent CTIQ estimators while the CNN models are consistent identifiers of structural similarities for CT image data sets.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7841003","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841003","CT image;Convolutional neural network;Image variability;Region of interest","Big data;Computed tomography;Data models;Image quality;Image segmentation;Lungs;Measurement","Big Data;backpropagation;computerised tomography;convolution;data analysis;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets","Big Data analytics;CNN model;CT image quality;CTIQ;ROI;automated estimation;computed tomography images;convolutional neural network;data models;data set variabilities;error back-propagation;image acquisition parameters;medical image processing systems;medical image quality assessment techniques;predictive modeling;quantitative image assessment;regions-of-interest;segmented pixel variabilities;spatial segmentation;time complexities","","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) endocardium at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) enables automated quantification of various clinical parameters including ejection fraction. Neural networks have been used for general image segmentation, usually via per-pixel categorization e.g. ‚Äúforeground‚Äù and ‚Äúbackground‚Äù. In this paper we propose that the generally circular LV endocardium can be parameterized and the endocardial contour determined via neural network regression. We designed two convolutional neural networks (CNN), one for localization of the LV, and the other for determining the endocardial radius. We trained the networks against 100 datasets from the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2011 challenge, and tested the networks against 45 datasets from the MICCAI 2009 challenge. The networks achieved 0.88 average Dice metric, 2.30 mm average perpendicular distance, and 97.9% good contours, the latter being the highest published result to date. These results demonstrate that CNN regression is a viable and highly promising method for automated LV endocardial segmentation at ED and ES phases, and is capable of generalizing learning between highly distinct training and testing data sets.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7791-1; POD:978-1-4673-7792-8","10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843499","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7843499","cardiac MRI;left ventricle;neural network regression;segmentation","Blood;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Measurement;Neural networks;Standards;Training","biomedical MRI;cardiology;diseases;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets;regression analysis","Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention;automated segmentation;cardiac MRI;cardiac left ventricle segmentation;cardiovascular disease assessment;cardiovascular disease diagnosis;circular left ventricular endocardium;convolutional neural network regression;ejection fraction;endocardial contour;general image segmentation","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides DDIs reported in medical knowledge bases such as DrugBank, a large number of latest DDI findings are also reported in unstructured biomedical literature. Extracting DDIs from unstructured biomedical literature is a worthy addition to the existing knowledge bases. Currently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is a state-of-the-art method for DDI extraction. One limitation of CNN is that it neglects long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, which may be helpful for DDI extraction. In order to incorporate the long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, in this work, we propose a dependency-based convolutional neural network (DCNN) for DDI extraction. Experiments conducted on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus show that DCNN using a public state-of-the-art dependency parser achieves an F-score of 70.19%, outperforming CNN by 0.44%. By analyzing errors of DCNN, we find that errors from dependency parsers are propagated into DCNN and affect the performance of DCNN. To reduce error propagation, we design a simple rule to combine CNN with DCNN, that is, using DCNN to extract DDIs in short sentences and CNN to extract DDIs in long distances as most dependency parsers work well for short sentences but bad for long sentences. Finally, our system that combines CNN and DCNN achieves an F-score of 70.81%, outperforming CNN by 1.06% and DNN by 0.62% on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822671","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822671","Biomedical literature;Dependency-based convolutional neural network;Drug-drug interaction","Drugs;Neural networks;TV","drugs;feature extraction;health care;medical computing;neural nets","DDIExtraction 2013 corpus;DrugBank;F-score;dependency-based convolutional neural network;drug-drug interaction extraction;healthcare;medical knowledge bases;public state-of-the-art dependency parser;unstructured biomedical literature","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821697","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821697","Alzheimer's Disease;Deep learning;fMRI","Alzheimer's disease;Biological neural networks;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neurons","biomedical MRI;convolution;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;neural nets;pattern classification","Alzheimer disease;Alzheimers brain;CNN;LeNet-5 architecture;biomedical sciences;clinical data classification;convolutional neural network;deep learning-based pipeline;drug delivery systems;functional MRI data classification;machine learning;medical imaging;pattern recognition;predictive modeling;scale invariant features extraction","","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, shortage of medical resources is a critical global problem. As a result, an intelligent prognostics system has a great potential to play important roles in computer aided diagnosis. Numerous papers reported that tongue features have been closely related to a human's state. Among them, the majority of the existing tongue image analyses and classification methods are based on the low-level features, which may not provide a holistic view of the tongue. Inspired by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose a deep tongue image feature analysis system to extract unbiased features and reduce human labor for tongue diagnosis. With the unbalanced sample distribution, it is hard to form a balanced classification model based on feature representations obtained by existing low-level and high-level methods. Our proposed deep tongue image feature analysis model learns high-level features and provide more classification information during training time, which may result in higher accuracy when predicting testing samples. We tested the proposed system on a set of 267 gastritis patients, and a control group of 48 healthy volunteers (labeled according to Western medical practices). Test results show that the proposed deep tongue image feature analysis model can classify a given tongue image into healthy and diseased state with an average accuracy of 91.49%, which demonstrates the relationship between human body's state and its deep tongue image features.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822815","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822815","Tongue image;deep model;feature analysis;weighted SVM","Analytical models;Biomedical imaging;Computational modeling;Radio frequency;Sensitivity;Shape;Support vector machines","convolution;feature extraction;image classification;medical image processing;neural nets","computer aided diagnosis;deep convolutional neural network;deep tongue image classification methods;deep tongue image feature analysis model;intelligent prognostic system;medical application","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the literature, two types of features are typically used to perform this task: visual features and tool usage signals. However, the used visual features are mostly handcrafted. Furthermore, the tool usage signals are usually collected via a manual annotation process or by using additional equipment. In this paper, we propose a novel method for phase recognition that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn features from cholecystectomy videos and that relies uniquely on visual information. In previous studies, it has been shown that the tool usage signals can provide valuable information in performing the phase recognition task. Thus, we present a novel CNN architecture, called EndoNet, that is designed to carry out the phase recognition and tool presence detection tasks in a multi-task manner.

Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels.

While the filters learned by these CNNs are related to the atomic structures of the images from which they are learnt, all datasets learn similar looking low-level filters. With the understanding that a dataset that contains many such atomic structures learn general filters and are therefore useful to initialize other networks with, we propose a way to analyse and quantify generality. We applied this metric on several popular character recognition, natural image and a medical image dataset, and arrive at some interesting conclusions. On further experimentation we also discovered that particular classes in a dataset themselves are more general than others.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9961-6; POD:978-1-4673-9962-3","10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532315","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7532315","","Atomic layer deposition;Colonoscopy;Computer vision;Detectors;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Training","feature extraction;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","CNN;convolutional neural networks;image datasets;initialization technique;low-level filters;medical image dataset;neural image features;transfer learning","","","","16","","","","25-28 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) have become state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks in recent years. In this paper, we propose the use of CNN's for the automated classification of colonic mucosa for colon polyp staging in the context of colon cancer screening. This deep learning approach has the property of extracting features and classifying images in the same architecture by exploiting directly the input image pixels being successful in handling distortions such as different light conditions, presence of partial occlusions, etc. For this type of deep learning approach it is common to require that the database contains large amounts of data, which is quite rare in the medical field. The method proposed allows the use of small patches (subimages) to increase the size of the database as well to classify different regions in the same image. We show experimentally that this model is more efficient than some of the commonly used features for colonic polyp classification.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9036-1; POD:978-1-4673-9037-8","10.1109/CBMS.2016.39","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545996","Colonic Polyp Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning","Biological neural networks;Cancer;Colonic polyps;Endoscopes;Feature extraction;Training","biological organs;cancer;computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","CNN;automated colonic mucosa classification;colon cancer screening;colon polyp staging;colonic polyp classification;computer vision;computer-aided medical system;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;distortion handling;feature extraction;image classification;image pixels;partial occlusion;texture patch classification","","1","","","","","","20-24 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to make reliable judgments for clinical usage, accurate and robust segmentation methods are needed. Due to the high complexity of biological vasculature trees, manual identification is often too time-consuming and tedious to be used in practice. To design an automated and computerized method, a major challenge is that the appearance of vasculatures in medical images has great variance across modalities and subjects. Therefore, most existing approaches are specially designed for a particular task, lacking the flexibility to be adapted to other circumstances. In this paper, we present a generic approach for vascular structure identification from medical images, which can be used for multiple purposes robustly. The proposed method uses the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the appearance features of the target. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based nearest neighbor search is then utilized to estimate the local structure distribution, which is further incorporated within the generalized probabilistic tracking framework to extract the entire connected tree. Qualitative and quantitative results over retinal fundus data demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable accuracy as compared with state-of-the-art methods, while efficiently producing more information regarding the candidate tree structure.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2349-6; POD:978-1-4799-2351-9","10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493520","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493520","Deep Learning;Generalized Probabilistic Tracking;Nearest Neighbor Search;Principal Component Analysis;Vascular Structure","Biomedical imaging;Dictionaries;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Robustness","","","","1","","10","","","","13-16 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a set of handcrafted image features together with features derived form a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we build a classification scheme to map a given CT slice to the relevant level.

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories.

In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the CNN training for medical image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images. A decreased training time from 170 epochs to 60 epochs with an increased performance-on par with two human experts-was achieved with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.894 and 0.972 on two data sets.

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2535302","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426826","Carotid intima-media thickness;computer-aided detection;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;fine-tuning;medical image analysis;polyp detection;pulmonary embolism detection;video quality assessment","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Training;Tuning","biomedical optical imaging;endoscopes;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets","cardiology;classification;deep convolutional neural network;distinct medical imaging applications;gastroenterology;imaging modalities;labeled training data;layer-wise fine-tuning scheme;medical image analysis;radiology;segmentation","","34","","76","","","20160307","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Deep learning techniques have recently achieved impressive results in a variety of computer vision problems, raising expectations that they might be applied in other domains, such as medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed for the classification of ILD patterns. The proposed network consists of 5 convolutional layers with 2 √ó 2 kernels and LeakyReLU activations, followed by average pooling with size equal to the size of the final feature maps and three dense layers. The last dense layer has 7 outputs, equivalent to the classes considered: healthy, ground glass opacity (GGO), micronodules, consolidation, reticulation, honeycombing and a combination of GGO/reticulation. To train and evaluate the CNN, we used a dataset of 14696 image patches, derived by 120 CT scans from different scanners and hospitals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep CNN designed for the specific problem. A comparative analysis proved the effectiveness of the proposed CNN against previous methods in a challenging dataset. The classification performance ( ~ 85.5%) demonstrated the potential of CNNs in analyzing lung patterns.

For example, most human identity information exists in the image patches containing human faces. The same situation stays in medical images as well. ‚ÄúBodypart identity‚Äù of a transversal slice-which bodypart the slice comes from-is often indicated by local image information, e.g., a cardiac slice and an aorta arch slice are only differentiated by the mediastinum region. In this work, we design a multi-stage deep learning framework for image classification and apply it on bodypart recognition. Specifically, the proposed framework aims at: 1) discover the local regions that are discriminative and non-informative to the image classification problem, and 2) learn a image-level classifier based on these local regions. We achieve these two tasks by the two stages of learning scheme, respectively. In the pre-train stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is learned in a multi-instance learning fashion to extract the most discriminative and and non-informative local patches from the training slices. In the boosting stage, the pre-learned CNN is further boosted by these local patches for image classification. The CNN learned by exploiting the discriminative local appearances becomes more accurate than those learned from global image context. The key hallmark of our method is that it automatically discovers the discriminative and non-informative local patches through multi-instance deep learning. Thus, no manual annotation is required. Our method is validated on a synthetic dataset and a large scale CT dataset.

They have been recognized as important diagnostic biomarkers for many cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. In current clinical routine, CMBs are manually labelled by radiologists but this procedure is laborious, time-consuming, and error prone. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method to detect CMBs from magnetic resonance (MR) images by exploiting the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared with previous methods that employed either low-level hand-crafted descriptors or 2D CNNs, our method can take full advantage of spatial contextual information in MR volumes to extract more representative high-level features for CMBs, and hence achieve a much better detection accuracy. To further improve the detection performance while reducing the computational cost, we propose a cascaded framework under 3D CNNs for the task of CMB detection. We first exploit a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) strategy to retrieve the candidates with high probabilities of being CMBs, and then apply a well-trained 3D CNN discrimination model to distinguish CMBs from hard mimics. Compared with traditional sliding window strategy, the proposed 3D FCN strategy can remove massive redundant computations and dramatically speed up the detection process. We constructed a large dataset with 320 volumetric MR scans and performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed method, which achieved a high sensitivity of 93.16% with an average number of 2.74 false positives per subject, outperforming previous methods using low-level descriptors or 2D CNNs by a significant margin.

Recent work suggested that CNN features are generic and can be used for classification tasks outside the exact domain for which the networks were trained. In this work we use the features from one such network, OverFeat, trained for object detection in natural images, for nodule detection in computed tomography scans. We use 865 scans from the publicly available LIDC data set, read by four thoracic radiologists. Nodule candidates are generated by a state-of-the-art nodule detection system. We extract 2D sagittal, coronal and axial patches for each nodule candidate and extract 4096 features from the penultimate layer of OverFeat and classify these with linear support vector machines. We show for various configurations that the off-the-shelf CNN features perform surprisingly well, but not as good as the dedicated detection system. When both approaches are combined, significantly better results are obtained than either approach alone.

Based on the results from the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers and shape statistics, we use the narrow-band graph cut optimization to achieve the 3D segmentation of femur surface.

Initially, the MRI image is pre-processed to make it fit for segmentation. Here, in the pre-processing step, image de-noising is done using the linear smoothing filters, such as Gaussian Filter. Then, the pre-processed image is segmented according to our proposed technique, CNN-based image segmentation. Finally, the different MRI images (brain and lung) are given to the proposed approach to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in segmentation process. The Comparative analysis is carried out Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means classification.

There are few rules in Cellular Neural Network that has to be implemented when designing the templates, such as state equation, output equation, boundary equation, and also the initial value. These templates are combined to create the most ideal algorithm to detect the pneumonia symptoms in an image. Candy software is used as a CNN simulator to detect the pneumonia symptoms area.

Restoring partial vision to the blind patients that suffer from degenerative disease has become an important medical and scientific task. However, there are some doubts on how to propose the stimulation signals. The same question arises when the stimulation may be done by trans-corneal or transdermic pathways. One method that could be used is to apply a no-parametric algorithm to obtain a nonlinear model representing the relationship between the optical nerve response signal and the stimulus inputs. Then, it can be applied an inverse model methodology to identify the unknown inputs required to obtain the desired optical nerve response. In this study, we proposed an adaptive modeling based in continuous neural networks (CNN) to obtain an artificial model of the relationship between the optical nerve response and the selective stimulation. This model tries to determine the adequate stimulation signals that will be applied on the trans-corneal or transepidermic part of the eye. Indeed, the input signal effectiveness will be measured as the degree of accuracy obtaining the desired response in the optical nerve. A set of CNN working as a parallel identifier provides the adaptive model of the aforementioned relation. An artificial optical nerve response was developed as well as the electrical stimulator for the trans-corneal area. These both designs were applied into the CNN identifier to test the methodology suggested in this paper. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy achieved by the modeling algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7314-4; POD:978-1-4244-7312-0","10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5608568","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5608568","Electrical Stimulation;Optical Nerve;Trans-corneal Prosthesis and Adaptive Neural Networks","Adaptation model;Adaptive optics;Artificial neural networks;Biomedical optical imaging;Electrodes;Nonlinear optics;Stimulated emission","eye;neural nets;neurophysiology;prosthetics;vision","adaptive modeling;blind patient;continuous neural network;optical nerve;partial vision;retinal prosthesis design;transcorneal pathway;transdermic pathway;wireless transcorneal stimulus","","0","","15","","","","8-10 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with conventional digital technology, cellular neural/nonlinear network (CNN)-based computing is capable of realizing these TeraOPS-range image processing tasks in a cost-effective implementation. To exploit the computing power of the CNN Universal Machine (CNN-UM), the CNN chipset architecture has been developed-a mixed-signal hardware platform for CNN-based image processing. One of the nonstandard components of the chipset is the cache memory of the analog array processor, the analog random access memory (ARAM). This paper reports on an ARAM chip that has been designed and fabricated in a 0.5-Œºm CMOS technology. This chip consists of a fully addressable array of 32√ó256 analog memory registers and has a packing density of 637 analog-memory-cells/mm<sup>2</sup>. Random and nondestructive access of the memory contents is available. Bottom-plate sampling techniques have been employed to eliminate harmonic distortion introduced by signal-dependent feedthrough. Signal coupling and interaction have been minimized by proper layout measures, including the use of protection rings and separate power supplies for the analog and the digital circuitry.

This allows an added flexibility as different processing applications can be performed in parallel. To be able to handle a full range of color tones, two novel color mapping schemes were derived. In the proposed schemes the color information is obtained from the cell's state rather than from its output. This modification is necessary because for many templates CNN has only binary stable outputs from which only either a fully saturated or a black color can be obtained. Additionally, a postprocessor capable of performing pixelwise logical operations among color layers was developed to enhance the results obtained from CNN.

They can be measured by affixing eye proximal electrodes, as in electrooculography (EOG) and chest electrodes, as in electrocardiography (EKG), however this complicates imaging setup, decreases patient comfort, and often induces further artifacts from facial twitching and postural muscle movement.

First, we combine a data driven, multivariate decomposition approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a highly accurate classifier constructed as a deep 1-D Convolutional Neural Network. Second, we visualize the features learned to reveal what features the model uses and to bolster user confidence in our model's training and potential for generalization. We train and test three variants of our method on resting state MEG data from 49 subjects. Our cardiac model achieves a 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity on the set-aside test-set. Our eye-blink model achieves a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. This work facilitates automated MEG processing for both, clinical and research use, and can obviate the need for EOG or EKG electrodes.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3159-1; POD:978-1-5386-3160-7","10.1109/PRNI.2017.7981506","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7981506","CNN;EKG;EOG;MEG;artifact;deep learning","Brain modeling;Convolution;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Electrooculography;Neuroscience;Sensitivity","cardiology;eye;gait analysis;independent component analysis;magnetoencephalography;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neural nets","ICA;MEG acquisition;MEG processing;affixing eye proximal electrodes;automatic 1D convolutional neural network-based detection;cardiac activity;cardiac model;chest electrodes;electrical neuronal activity;eye-blink model;eye-blinks activity;facial twitching;feature learning;functional neuroimaging tool;independent component analysis;magnetic fields;magnetoencephalography;multivariate decomposition approach;nonneuronal artifacts;nonneuronal sources;postural muscle movement","","","","","","","","21-23 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method enhances the features of tongue images with preprocessing to ensure the data suitable for tongue shape binary classification. In view of the special texture and outline of tongue, the whole tongue images of dot-sting tongue and fissured tongue is transformed by Gabor filter, and the tooth-marked are processed by boundary detection approach. CNN is adopted because it has achieved remarkable results in computer vision and pattern recognition, and the model training through neural network coincides with the Chinese medicine dialectics through experience.

However, image gross inhomogeneities and fetal random movements make the segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, a dynamic convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on multiscale information and fine-tuning is proposed for fetal LV segmentation. The CNN is pretrained by amount of labeled training data. In the segmentation, the first frame of each echocardiographic sequence is delineated manually. The dynamic CNN is fine-tuned by deep tuning with the first frame and shallow tuning with the rest of frames, respectively, to adapt to the individual fetus. Additionally, to separate the connection region between LV and left atrium (LA), a matching approach, which consists of block matching and line matching, is used for mitral valve (MV) base points tracking. Advantages of our proposed method are compared with an active contour model (ACM), a dynamical appearance model (DAM), and a fixed multiscale CNN method. Experimental results in 51 echocardiographic sequences show that the segmentation results agree well with the ground truth, especially in the cases with leakage, blurry boundaries, and subject-to-subject variations.

Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of hyperparameter selection. The starting point of this paper is the observation that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by pointwise nonlinearity) when the normal operator (H*H, where H* is the adjoint of the forward imaging operator, H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms.

To reduce the pathologists' workload, but also to reduce variations between different pathologists, an automatic classification system would be of great use. Some previous works have aimed for this, but still more work needs to be done. It is probable that such a tool would benefit from having access to individually segmented, pathologically relevant objects from the images. Therefore, we have developed an algorithm for semantic segmentation of the microscopic images of H&E stained prostate tissue into Background, Stroma, Epithelial Cytoplasm and Nuclei. This algorithm is based on deep learning, or more specifically a convolutional neural network. The network design is inspired by architectures that previously have been proved successful in different applications. It consists of a contracting and an expanding part, which are symmetrical. We have reached an accuracy of 80 %, as measured by the mean of the intersection over union, for segmentation into four classes. Previous works have only investigated nuclei segmentation, and our network performed similar but for the more challenging task of four class segmentation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6182-2; POD:978-1-5090-6183-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7965996","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965996","","Cancer;Gold;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Neural networks;Semantics;Standards","biological tissues;cancer;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets;patient diagnosis","CNN;H&E stained prostatic tissue;automatic Gleason scoring system;automatic classification system;epithelial cytoplasm;microscopic image semantic segmentation;prostate cancer diagnosis","","","","","","","","14-19 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a number of close similarities, including the distributions of population response sparseness across stimuli, and the distribution of size tuning bandwidth. Statisics of scale invariance, responses to clutter and occlusion, and orientation tuning are less similar. Statistics of object selectivity are quite different.

The accuracy and robustness of brain extraction, therefore, is crucial for the accuracy of the entire brain analysis process. State-of-the-art brain extraction techniques rely heavily on the accuracy of alignment or registration between brain atlases and query brain anatomy, and/or make assumptions about the image geometry; therefore have limited success when these assumptions do not hold or image registration fails. With the aim of designing an accurate, learning-based, geometry-independent and registration-free brain extraction tool in this study, we present a technique based on an auto-context convolutional neural network (CNN), in which intrinsic local and global image features are learned through 2D patches of different window sizes. We consider two different architectures: 1) a voxelwise approach based on three parallel 2D convolutional pathways for three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) that implicitly learn 3D image information without the need for computationally expensive 3D convolutions, and 2) a fully convolutional network based on the U-net architecture. Posterior probability maps generated by the networks are used iteratively as context information along with the original image patches to learn the local shape and connectedness of the brain to extract it from non-brain tissue. The brain extraction results we have obtained from our CNNs are superior to the recently reported results in the literature on two publicly available benchmark datasets, namely LPBA40 and OASIS, in which we obtained Dice overlap coefficients of 97.73% and 97.62%, respectively. Significant improvement was achieved via our auto-context algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our algorithm in the challenging problem of extracting arbitrarily-oriented fetal brains in reconstructed fe- al brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. In this application our voxelwise auto-context CNN performed much better than the other methods (Dice coefficient: 95.97%), where the other methods performed poorly due to the non-standard orientation and geometry of the fetal brain in MRI. Through training, our method can provide accurate brain extraction in challenging applications. This in-turn may reduce the problems associated with image registration in segmentation tasks.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2721362","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961201","Auto-Context;Brain extraction;CNN;Convolutional neural network;MRI;U-net;Whole brain segmentation","Computer architecture;Context;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","","","","","","","","","20170628","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Despite a number of prior attempts, this task remains very challenging, especially when images are contaminated by noises or have discontinued segments of neurite patterns. An approach for addressing such problems is to identify the locations of neuronal voxels using image segmentation methods, prior to applying tracing or reconstruction techniques. This preprocessing step is expected to remove noises in the data, thereby leading to improved reconstruction results. In this paper, we proposed to use 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting the neuronal microscopy images. Specifically, we designed a novel CNN architecture, that takes volumetric images as the inputs and their voxel-wise segmentation maps as the outputs. The developed architecture allows us to train and predict using large microscopy images in an end-to-end manner.

While techniques like whole-slide imaging have enabled computer assisted analysis for exhaustive reporting of the tissue section, it has also given rise to the big-data deluge and the time complexity associated with processing GBs of image data acquired over multiple magnifications. Since preliminary screening of a slide into benign or malignant carried out on the fly during the digitization process can reduce a Pathologist's work load, to devote more time for detailed analysis, slide screening has to be performed on the fly with high sensitivity. We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based solution, where we analyse images from random number of regions of the tissue section at multiple magnifications without any necessity of view correspondence across magnifications. Further a majority voting based approach is used for slide level diagnosis, i.e., the class posteriori estimate of each views at a particular magnification is obtained from the magnification specific CNN, and subsequently posteriori estimate across random multi-views at multi-magnification are voting filtered to provide a slide level diagnosis.

In this work, we present a hybrid classification framework for dermoscopy image assessment by combining deep convolutional neural network (CNN), Fisher vector (FV) and support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, the deep representations of subimages at various locations of a rescaled dermoscopy image are first extracted via a natural image dataset pre-trained on CNN. Then we adopt an orderless visual statistics based FV encoding methods to aggregate these features to build more invariant representations. Finally, the FV encoded representations are classified for diagnosis using a linear SVM. Compared with traditional low-level visual features based recognition approaches, our scheme is simpler and requires no complex preprocessing. Furthermore, the orderless representations are less sensitive to geometric deformation.

To address the challenging problem, we propose a novel breast cancer histopathological image classification method based on deep convolutional neural networks, named as BiCNN model, to address the two-class breast cancer classification on the pathological image. This deep learning model considers class and sub-class labels of breast cancer as prior knowledge, which can restrain the distance of features of different breast cancer pathological images.

The transfer learning and fine-tuning method are adopted as an optimal training strategy to improve breast cancer histopathological image classification accuracy.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting molecular profiles with CT imaging arrays in NSCLC. In particular, we formulate a discriminative convolutional neural network to learn deep features for predicting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation states that are associated with cancer cell growth. We evaluated our approach on two independent datasets including a discovery set with 595 patients (Datset1) and a validation set with 89 patients (Dataset2). Extensive experimental results demonstrated that the learned CNN-based features are effective in predicting EGFR mutation states (AUC=0.828, ACC=76.16%) on Dataset1, and it further demonstrated generalized predictive performance (AUC=0.668, ACC=67.55%) on Dataset2.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1172-8; POD:978-1-5090-1173-5","10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950585","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950585","Computed tomography;Computed-aided diagnosis;Convolutional neural networks;Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Cancer;Computed tomography;Convolution;Feature extraction;Lungs;Neural networks","cancer;cellular biophysics;computerised tomography;feature extraction;lung;medical image processing;molecular biophysics;neural nets;proteins","CT imaging arrays;EGFR mutation state prediction;biomarker identification;cancer cell growth;clinical imaging data;discriminative convolutional neural network;epidermal growth factor receptor;learned CNN-based feature;lung cancer computer-aided diagnosis;molecular profile;nonsmall cell lung cancer;quantitative imaging","","","","","","","","18-21 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modeling tfMRI data is challenging due to at least two problems: the lack of the ground truth of underlying neural activity and the highly complex intrinsic structure of tfMRI data. To better understand brain networks based on fMRI data, data-driven approaches have been proposed, for instance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL). However, both ICA and SDL only build shallow models, and they are under the strong assumption that original fMRI signal could be linearly decomposed into time series components with their corresponding spatial maps. As growing evidence shows that human brain function is hierarchically organized, new approaches that can infer and model the hierarchical structure of brain networks are widely called for. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has drawn much attention, in that deep CNN has proven to be a powerful method for learning high-level and mid-level abstractions from low-level raw data. Inspired by the power of deep CNN, in this study, we developed a new neural network structure based on CNN, called Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE), in order to take the advantages of both data-driven approach and CNN‚Äôs hierarchical feature abstraction ability for the purpose of learning mid-level and high-level features from complex, large-scale tfMRI time series in an unsupervised manner.

This paper presents ongoing language understanding experiments conducted as part of a larger effort to create a nutrition dialogue system that automatically extracts food concepts from a user's spoken meal description. We first summarize the data collection and annotation of food descriptions performed via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), for both a written corpus and spoken data from an in-domain speech recognizer. We show that the addition of word vector features improves conditional random field (CRF) performance for semantic tagging of food concepts, achieving an average F1 test score of 92.4 on written data; we also demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) with no hand-crafted features outperforms the best CRF on spoken data, achieving an F1 test score of 91.3. We illustrate two methods for associating foods with properties: segmenting meal descriptions with a CRF, and a complementary method that directly predicts associations with a feed-forward neural network.

The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw ECG time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the PAF to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain ECG signals by using a CNN with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end CNN classifier.

However, estimation of multitype cardiac indices with consistently reliable and high accuracy is still a great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structures and complexity of temporal dynamics in cardiac MR sequences. While efforts have been devoted into cardiac volumes estimation through feature engineering followed by a independent regression model, these methods suffer from the vulnerable feature representation and incompatible regression model. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated method for multitype cardiac indices estimation. After manual labelling of two landmarks for ROI cropping, an integrated deep neural network Indices-Net is designed to jointly learn the representation and regression models. It comprises two tightly-coupled networks: a deep convolution autoencoder (DCAE) for cardiac image representation, and a multiple output convolution neural network (CNN) for indices regression. Joint learning of the two networks effectively enhances the expressiveness of image representation with respect to cardiac indices, and the compatibility between image representation and indices regression, thus leading to accurate and reliable estimations for all the cardiac indices. When applied with five-fold cross validation on MR images of 145 subjects, Indices-Net achieves consistently low estimation error for LV wall thicknesses (1.440.71mm) and areas of cavity and myocardium (204133mm2). It outperforms, with significant error reductions, segmentation method (55.1% and 17.4%) and two-phase direct volume-only methods (12.7% and 14.6%) for wall thicknesses and areas, respectively.

We propose to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) jointly with an adversarial CNN to estimate routine-dose CT images from low-dose CT images and hence reduce noise. A generator CNN was trained to transform low-dose CT images into routine-dose CT images using voxel-wise loss minimization. An adversarial discriminator CNN was simultaneously trained to distinguish the output of the generator from routinedose CT images. The performance of this discriminator was used as an adversarial loss for the generator. Experiments were performed using CT images of an anthropomorphic phantom containing calcium inserts, as well as patient non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT images. The phantom and patients were scanned at 20% and 100% routine clinical dose. Three training strategies were compared: the first used only voxel-wise loss, the second combined voxel-wise loss and adversarial loss, and the third used only adversarial loss. The results showed that training with only voxel-wise loss resulted in the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio with respect to reference routine-dose images. However, the CNNs trained with adversarial loss captured image statistics of routine-dose images better. Noise reduction improved quantification of low-density calcified inserts in phantom CT images and allowed coronary calcium scoring in low-dose patient CT images with high noise levels. Testing took less than 10 seconds per CT volume. CNN-based low-dose CT noise reduction in the image domain is feasible. Training with an adversarial network improves the CNN‚Äôs ability to generate images with an appearance similar to that of reference routine-dose CT images.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2708987","Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development ZonMw; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934380","Low-dose cardiac CT;coronary calcium scoring;deep learning,;generative adversarial networks;noise reduction","Calcium;Computed tomography;Convolution;Generators;Noise reduction;Training;Transforms","","","","","","","","","20170526","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Supervised spatial filtering methods that enhance the discriminative information in EEG data are commonly used to improve single-trial ERP detection. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN is compared with three common classifiers: 1) Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; 2) multilayer perceptron (MLP); and 3) support vector machines. Prior to classification, the data were spatially filtered with xDAWN (for the maximization of the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio), common spatial pattern, or not spatially filtered. The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier. In addition, the nonlinear classifier MLP outperformed the linear methods. Finally, training based AUC maximization provided better performance than training based on the minimization of the mean square error. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the systems architecture is critical and both spatial filtering and classification must be considered together.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2302898","Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies through the U.S. Army Research Office; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737255","Brain‚Äìcomputer interface (BCI);Brain-computer interface (BCI);common spatial patterns (CSP);convolution;electroencephalogram (EEG);neural networks;rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP);spatial filters;spatial filters.","Biological neural networks;Convolution;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Sensors;Training;Visualization","Bayes methods;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal detection;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;signal classification;spatial filters;support vector machines;visual evoked potentials","Bayesian linear discriminant analysis;CNN;EEG data;area maximization;convolutional neural network;discriminative information;frequent nontarget stimuli;linear methods;machine learning techniques;mean square error minimization;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear classifier MLP;rapid serial visual presentation;rapid serial visual presentation tasks;receiver operating characteristic curve;signal processing;signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio;single-trial ERP detection;single-trial classification;single-trial event-related potentials;spatial pattern;supervised spatial filtering methods;support vector machines;target stimuli;training based AUC maximization;xDAWN","0;Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Area Under Curve;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Filtration;Humans;Male;Neural Networks (Computer);Photic Stimulation;ROC Curve;Reaction Time;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machine;Visual Perception;Young Adult","12","","61","","","20140211","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, automatic approaches are highly demanded in clinical practice to alleviate the workload and boost the examination efficiency. The automatic detection of standard planes from US videos remains a challenging problem due to the high intraclass and low interclass variations of standard planes, and the relatively low image quality. Unlike previous studies which were specifically designed for individual anatomical standard planes, respectively, we present a general framework for the automatic identification of different standard planes from US videos. Distinct from conventional way that devises hand-crafted visual features for detection, our framework explores in- and between-plane feature learning with a novel composite framework of the convolutional and recurrent neural networks. To further address the issue of limited training data, a multitask learning framework is implemented to exploit common knowledge across detection tasks of distinctive standard planes for the augmentation of feature learning.

Due to its low costs and wide availability, carotid ultrasound has the potential to become the modality of choice for plaque characterization in clinical practice. However, its significant image noise, coupled with the small size of the plaques and their complex appearance, makes it difficult for automated techniques to discriminate between the different plaque constituents. In this paper, we propose to address this challenging problem by exploiting the unique capabilities of the emerging deep learning framework. More specifically, and unlike existing works which require a priori definition of specific imaging features or thresholding values, we propose to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will automatically extract from the images the information that is optimal for the identification of the different plaque constituents. We used approximately 90 000 patches extracted from a database of images and corresponding expert plaque characterizations to train and to validate the proposed CNN.

Early detection of cancer would facilitate in saving millions of lives across the globe every year. This paper presents an approach which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to classify tumours seen in lung cancer screening computed tomography scans as malignant or benign. CNNs have special properties such as spatial invariance, and allow for multiple feature extraction. When such layers are cascaded, leading to Deep CNNs, it has been shown widely that the accuracy of prediction increases dramatically. In this work, we have designed a CNN suitable for the analysis of CT scans with tumours, using domain knowledge from both medicine and neural networks. The results show that the accuracy of classification for our network performs better than both the traidtional neural networks, and also existing CNNs built for image classification purposes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5256-1; POD:978-1-5090-5257-8; USB:978-1-5090-5255-4","10.1109/IC3I.2016.7918014","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918014","","Cancer;Computed tomography;Computer architecture;Convolution;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Tumors","cancer;computerised tomography;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;lung;medical image processing","CT scan analysis;cancer detection;cancer diagnosis;computed tomography scans;convolutional neural networks;deep CNN;feature extraction;image classification purposes;lung cancer screening;tumour classification","","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Skin disease classification versus skin lesion characterization: Achieving robust diagnosis using multi-label deep neural networks","Haofu Liao; Yuncheng Li; Jiebo Luo","Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, New York 14627, USA","2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","20170424","2016","","","355","360","In this study, we investigate what a practically useful approach is in order to achieve robust skin disease diagnosis. A direct approach is to target the ground truth diagnosis labels, while an alternative approach instead focuses on determining skin lesion characteristics that are more visually consistent and discernible. We argue that, for computer aided skin disease diagnosis, it is both more realistic and more useful that lesion type tags should be considered as the target of an automated diagnosis system such that the system can first achieve a high accuracy in describing skin lesions, and in turn facilitate disease diagnosis using lesion characteristics in conjunction with other evidences. To further meet such an objective, we employ convolutional neutral networks (CNNs) for both the disease-targeted and lesion-targeted classifications. We have collected a large-scale and diverse dataset of 75,665 skin disease images from six publicly available dermatology atlantes. Then we train and compare both disease-targeted and lesion-targeted classifiers, respectively. For disease-targeted classification, only 27.6% top-1 accuracy and 57.9% top-5 accuracy are achieved with a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.42. In contrast, for lesion-targeted classification, we can achieve a much higher mAP of 0.70.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899659","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899659","convolutional neural networks;skin disease classification;skin lesion characterization","Dermatology;Diseases;Lesions;Malignant tumors;Skin;Training;Visualization","diseases;medical image processing;neural nets;skin","CNN;automated diagnosis system;computer aided skin disease diagnosis;convolutional neutral networks;disease-targeted classification;ground truth diagnosis labels;lesion-targeted classifications;lesion-targeted classifiers;mean average precision;multilabel deep neural networks;publicly available dermatology atlantes;robust diagnosis;robust skin disease diagnosis;skin disease classification;skin lesion characteristics;skin lesion characterization","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given an image containing a psoriatic plaque the task is to predict severity scores for all the three parameters. This paper presents a novel deep CNN based architecture for achieving the task. Apart from viewing this task as three different single task learning (STL) problems (i.e. three different classification problems), a new multi-task learning (MTL) is also presented where the three classification tasks are treated as interdependent and thereby the neural net is trained accordingly. A new annotated dataset consisting of seven hundred and seven (707) images has been constructed on which the performance of the severity scoring algorithms have been reported. Several competing baselines are considered to compare the performance of STL and MTL approaches.

Pathology examination requires time consuming scanning through tissue images under different magnification levels to find clinical assessment clues to produce correct diagnoses. Advances in digital imaging techniques offers assessment of pathology images using computer vision and machine learning methods which could automate some of the tasks in the diagnostic pathology workflow. Such automation could be beneficial to obtain fast and precise quantification, reduce observer variability, and increase objectivity. In this work, we propose to classify breast cancer histopathology images independent of their magnifications using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose two different architectures; single task CNN is used to predict malignancy and multi-task CNN is used to predict both malignancy and image magnification level simultaneously. Evaluations and comparisons with previous results are carried out on BreaKHis dataset. Experimental results show that our magnification independent CNN approach improved the performance of magnification specific model. Our results in this limited set of training data are comparable with previous state-of-the-art results obtained by hand-crafted features. However, unlike previous methods, our approach has potential to directly benefit from additional training data, and such additional data could be captured with same or different magnification levels than previous data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900002","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7900002","","Breast cancer;Databases;Microscopy;Pathology;Training;Training data","cancer;computer vision;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","BreaKHis dataset;breast tissues;computer vision;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;diagnostic pathology workflow;digital imaging techniques;image classification;machine learning;magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification;microscopic analysis;multitask CNN;single task CNN","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There exists a research trend for computerized analysis of suspicious skin lesions for malignancy using images captured by digital cameras. Analysis of these images is usually challenging due to existence of disturbing factors such as illumination variations and light reflections from skin surface. One important stage in diagnosis of melanoma is segmentation of lesion region from normal skin. In this paper, a method for accurate extraction of lesion region is proposed that is based on deep learning approaches. The input image, after being preprocessed to reduce noisy artifacts, is applied to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN combines local and global contextual information and outputs a label for each pixel, producing a segmentation mask that shows the lesion region. This mask will be further refined by some post processing operations.

Previous work on automatically predicting KL grades from radiograph images were based on training shallow classifiers using a variety of hand engineered features. We demonstrate that classification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images. Furthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of automatic knee OA severity predictions using a continuous distance-based evaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification accuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a regression problem and further improves accuracy.

In recent automated image recognition tasks, deep learning with convolutional neural nets (CNN) has achieved remarkable results. However in many clinical settings, training data is often limited and insufficient for CNN training. For recognition of RCM skin images, we demonstrate that a CNN trained on a moderate size dataset leads to low accuracy. We introduce a hybrid deep learning approach which uses traditional texton-based feature vectors as input to train a deep neural network. This hybrid method uses fixed filters in the input layer instead of tuned filters, yet superior performance is achieved. Our dataset consists of 1500 images from 15 RCM stacks belonging to six different categories of skin layers. We show that our hybrid deep learning approach performs with a test accuracy of 82% compared with 51% for CNN.

In this work, a specimen pattern recognition system combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pattern histogram was proposed. The pattern histograms were obtained based on the prediction of each single cell inside the specimens. Two strategies were designed to predicted the pattern of a whole specimen: 1) the most dominant cell pattern in pattern histogram was represented as the specimen pattern, 2) the pattern histograms were employed as bags of patterns and then were trained and predicted separately by a SVM classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed system is effective and achieves high classification accuracy on public benchmark datasets.

Not only it is associated with reduced quality of life, but also increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, many cases of AF are clinically silent and undiagnosed, but long-term monitoring is difficult. Nonetheless, efforts at monitoring at-risk individuals and detecting clinically silent AF may yield significant public health benefit, as individuals with new-onset, asymptomatic AF would receive preventive therapies with anticoagulants and beta-blockers, for example. Wearables have enormous potential to provide low-risk and low-cost long-term monitoring of AF, but signals from such devices suffer from significant movement related noise that resembles AF. This work presents a robust approach to AF detection in a sequence of short windows with significant movement artifact. Pulsatile photoplethysmographic (PPG) data and triaxial accelerometry from 98 subjects (45 with AF and 53 with other rhythms) were captured using a multichannel wrist-worn device. A single channel electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded (for rhythm verification only) simultaneously. A novel deep neural network approach to classify AF from wrist-worn PPG signals was developed on this data. A continuous wavelet transform was applied to the PPG data and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on the derived spectrograms to detect AF. Combining the output of the CNN with features calculated based on beat-to-beat variability and signal quality provided a significant accuracy boost. Leave-one-out cross validation resulted in a pooled AUC of 0.95 (Accuracy=91.8%). The proposed approach resulted in a novel robust and accurate algorithm for detection of AF from PPG data, which is scalable and likely to improve in accuracy as the dataset size continues to expand.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4179-4; POD:978-1-5090-4180-0","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897225","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897225","","Biomedical monitoring;Detection algorithms;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Heart beat;Wavelet transforms","accelerometers;diseases;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neural nets;photoplethysmography;wavelet transforms","ECG;PPG data;atrial fibrillation detection;atrial fibrillation monitoring;cardiac arrhythmia;continuous wavelet transform;convolutional neural network;deep learning approach;deep neural network;electrocardiogram;multichannel wrist-worn device;myocardial infarction;pulsatile photoplethysmographic data;signal quality;triaxial accelerometry;wearable technology;wrist-worn PPG signal","","","","","","","","16-19 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these methods can easily fall into overfitting, since a huge number of parameters must be learned. Having bigger datasets may act as regularization and lead to better models. Yet, acquiring and manually annotating images, especially in the medical field, can be a long and costly procedure. Hence, when using regular datasets, people heavily need to apply artificial data augmentation. In this work, we use a fully convolutional neural network capable of reaching the state-of-the-art.

However, there are very few works addressed to analyze the whole-slide digitized images (WSI) because their large resolution (e.g. 80,000 √ó 80,000 pixels at 40√ó magnification) resulting in huge computational cost for automatic analysis. This paper presents an application design of a meta-heuristic optimization method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for exploration and exploitation of regions of interest for diagnosis in a WSI in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained in previous works [10], [11]. The preliminary results show that presented solution scales in computing time given the initial number of samples (initial population). The developed application in Java including the GA method for WSI analysis could be used for diagnosis support by pathologists thanks of its usability and visual interpretability through a probability map of the invasive tumor regions in the WSI.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5105-2; POD:978-1-5090-5106-9; USB:978-1-5090-5104-5","10.1109/LA-CCI.2016.7885738","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885738","Adaptive Sampling;Convolutional Neural Network;Digital pathology;Genetic Algorithm;Whole-Slide Imaging","Biological cells;Cancer;Genetic algorithms;Pathology;Sociology;Statistics;Tumors","cancer;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;tumours","CNN training;Java;WSI analysis;cancer research;clinical practice;complete pathology slide digitalization;convolutional neural network;diagnosis;digital pathology application;genetic algorithm;invasive tumor region;metaheuristic optimization method;probability map;visual interpretability;whole slide scanner;whole-slide digitized image;whole-slide histopathology image analysis","","","","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deep learning has recently been a great interest in AD classification. Previous works had done almost on single modality dataset, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), shown high performances. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. The corporation of multimodalities can solve this issue since it discovers and uses the further complementary of hidden biomarkers from other modalities instead of only one, which itself cannot provide. We therefore propose a deep learning method on fusion multimodalities. In details, our approach includes Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) train and test on combined PET-MRI data to diagnose the disease status of a patient. We focus on advantages of multimodalities to help providing complementary information than only one, lead to improve classification accuracy. We conducted experiments in a dataset of 1272 scans from ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 90% between AD patients and healthy controls, demonstrate the improvement than using only one modality.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3015-6; POD:978-1-5090-3016-3; USB:978-1-5090-3014-9","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881683","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881683","Alzheimer's disease;MRI;PET;autoencoder;convolutional neural network;deep learning","Biological neural networks;Convolution;Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Support vector machines;Three-dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;convolution;diseases;image classification;image coding;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;positron emission tomography","Alzheimer disease diagnosis;convolution neural network;deep learning method;image fusion multimodalities;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal learning method;neuroimaging data;pattern recognition methods;positron emission tomography;sparse autoencoder","","","","","","","","13-16 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the availability, another device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so that the EEG signal have a deceleration.

The involuntary movements of subjects frequently infuse motion artifacts to SD-OCT images. Sub-sampling of signals is introduced in imaging protocol to avoid such artifacts which causes fall in spatial resolution and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Sparse coding (SC) is opted for restoration and rectification of complete signals from sparse samples through constructing complete and sparse space dictionaries independently. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be casted as SC for jointly learning dictionaries resulting less number of CNN filters (equivalence of SC dictionaries) to be trained. The proposed approach extends the separable filters to CNN through architectural constrain. This results in a parallel architecture and reduced number of parameters without compromising on performance.

The CNN is trained by back propagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch learning. To classify one sound recording, the signal should be filtered and segmented. Each segment of the signal is then classified by the trained CNN model. The model assigns each segment signal a relative probability between normal and abnormal labels. By accumulating these relative probability values for all the segmented signals, one can reliably and robustly determine whether the target signal is normal or abnormal.

The CNN has two convolutional layers for feature extraction, which lead into dense layers for classification. Second, the output CNN probabilities are then used to adaptively calculate the parameters of the active contour functional during the segmentation process. Finally, the adaptive window size surrounding each contour point is re-estimated by an iterative process that considers lesion size and spatial texture.

The proposed framework is tested on the MITOS data set provided for a contest on mitosis detection in breast cancer histological images released for research purposes in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'2014). By using provided histopathological images, cellular structures are initially found by combined clustering based segmentation and blob analysis after preprocessing step. Then, obtained cellular image patches are cropped automatically from the histopathological images for feature extraction stage. CNN, which is a prominent deep learning method on image processing tasks, is utilized for extracting discriminative features. Due to the high dimensional output of the CNN, combination of PCA and LDA dimension reduction methods are performed respectively for regularization and dimension reduction process. Afterwards, a robust kernel based classifier, support vector machine (SVM), is used for final classification of mitotic and non-mitotic cells.

In addition, memristor crossbars can be realized in 3-dimensional architecture like human brain. This possibility of 3-dimensional integration is crucial in implementing the full-scale electronic neuron-synapse system in future. One more thing to note here is that memristor-based neuromorphic systems can be more energy-efficient than the conventional Von Neumann ones in some applications such as bio-inspired pattern processing. This is because they are more suitable to brain-like parallel processing. Based on these advantages of memristor-based neuromorphic systems, this paper reviews the memristor logics, where the computation and memory can be merged together. Then, we introduce neuromorphic memristor crossbars which can mimic the brain's pattern recognition of speech and image. The simulation results of neuromorphic crossbars strongly highlight the future possibility of memristor circuits in brain-mimicking pattern processing. In Cellular Nanoscale Network (CNN), memristors can be used in analog multiplication that is essential to perform CNN pixel calculation with low power consumption and high-area density.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2959-4; POD:978-1-5090-2960-0","10.1109/BioCAS.2016.7833830","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833830","bio-inspired pattern processing;cellular nanoscale network;future computing;memristor logic;memristors;neuromorphic memristor crossbar","Computer architecture;Energy efficiency;Memristors;Neuromorphics;Speech;Speech recognition;Training","biomedical electronics;brain;medical image processing;memristor circuits;neurophysiology;parallel processing;pattern recognition","CNN pixel calculation;Von Neumann;bioinspired information processing;bioinspired pattern processing;biological neuronal system;brain pattern recognition;brain-like parallel processing;cellular nanoscale network;electronic neuron-synapse system;human brain;memory;memristor circuit;memristor logics;memristor-based neuromorphic system;neuromorphic memristor crossbar;power consumption;speech;synaptic plasticity","","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A solution to this problem is to automate the process by using vision sensors that determine the object's orientation and optimal grasp procedure. In this paper, we use a neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) to assist amputees with object grasping. Event-driven sensors such as the DVS have gained popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional frame-based sensors due to their low-power consumption and low-latency. Here, we use event data from a DVS to find a grasp-appropriate orientation for the object and subsequently its optimal grasp type. Our estimation technique exploits general assumptions such as object symmetry and grasps preference to be along the smallest major dimension of an object. The grasp type is determined through a combination of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. We evaluated our grasp estimation methodology on a set of 20 household objects. The results of this study show that 96.25% of the estimated orientations were within ¬±10¬∞ of the actual orientations.

However, it is not easy to realize the EEG-ER system which can recognize emotions with high accuracy because of the tendency for important information in EEG signals to be concealed by noises. Deep learning is the golden tool to grasp the features concealed in EEG data and enable highly accurate EEG-ER because deep neural networks (DNNs) may have higher recognition capability than humans'. The publicly available dataset named DEAP, which is for emotion analysis using EEG, was used in the experiment. The CNN and a conventional model used for comparison are evaluated by the tests according to 11-fold cross validation scheme. EEG raw data obtained from 16 electrodes without general preprocesses were used as input data. The models classify and recognize EEG signals according to the emotional states ""positive"" or ""negative"" which were caused by watching music videos. The results show that the more training data are, the much higher the accuracies of CNNs are (by over 20%). It also suggests that the increased training data need not to belong to the same person's EEG data as the test data so as to get the CNN recognizing emotions accurately.

However, it still remains as a challenging problem due to the image qualities, which largely results from the non-linear imaging mechanism and 3D imaging diffusion. To address these issues, we proposed a novel framework by incorporating the convolutional neural network (CNN) with a semi-supervised regularization term, which reduces the human efforts in labeling without sacrificing the performance. Specifically, we generate a putative label for each unlabeled sample regularized with a graph-smooth term, which are used as if they were true labels. A CNN model is therefore trained in a supervised fashion with labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously, which is used to detect neuron regions in 2D images. Afterwards, neuron segmentation in a 3D volume is conducted by associating the corresponding neuron regions in each image. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms neuron segmentation based on the graph-based semisupervised learning, the supervised CNN and variants of the semi-supervised CNN.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1437-8; POD:978-1-5090-1438-5","10.1109/CVPRW.2016.167","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789657","","Biological neural networks;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Neurons;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","feedforward neural nets;graph theory;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;two-photon spectroscopy","3D imaging diffusion;3D volume;convolutional neural network;graph-based semisupervised learning;graph-smooth term;image qualities;neural network activities;neuron region detection;neuron segmentation;nonlinear imaging mechanism;semisupervised regularization;supervised CNN model;two-photon microscopy images","","","","","","","","June 26 2016-July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most studies to date have investigated the features extracted from movements of the lower limbs and do not provide a holistic gait assessment. A recent pilot study demonstrated that the holistic gait assessment such as evaluating the associations among lower and upper limbs provided better discrimination between healthy controls and PwMS. This paper is motivated by this and further aim to answer the following question: can we identify the temporal gait patterns in terms of the holistic gait assessment? Traditionally this suffers from the statistical property of the causality inference method adopted by previous study. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the temporal and spectral associations among the time-series motion data captured by the inertial body sensors. A simulated model was developed to train the CNN, and then the trained CNN was adopted to assess the gait performance from a pilot dataset with 41 subjects (28 PwMS and 13 healthy controls).

However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.266","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780635","","Cancer;Image resolution;Neural networks;Predictive models;Robustness;Training;Visualization","cancer;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;optimisation","CNN training;EM based method;WSI;cancer subtype differentiation;cellular-level visual features;decision fusion model training;discriminative patch automatic location;expectation-maximization based method;glioma classification;image patch scale;nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma;patch spatial relationships;patch-based CNN;patch-based convolutional neural network;patch-level CNN;patch-level classifier;patch-level prediction aggregation;whole slide tissue image classification","","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable, offering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However, each CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each of these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic ultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI) in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT. These operations are tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the widespread utilization of CIMT in clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate CIMT video interpretation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system performs reliably. The reliable performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) coupled with our informative image representation and effective post-processing of the CNN outputs, which are uniquely designed for each of the above three operations.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.277","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780646","","Carotid arteries;Electrocardiography;Image restoration;Neural networks;Reliability;Training;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical ultrasonics;cardiovascular system;diseases;image representation;medical image processing;neural nets;video signal processing","CIMT examination;CIMT video interpretation;CNN outputs;CVD risk;ROI;at-risk individuals;cardiovascular disease;carotid intima-media thickness video interpretation automation;clinical practice;convolutional neural networks;end-diastolic ultrasound frames;informative image representation;lumen-intima interface;media-adventitia interface;noninvasive ultrasound method;ultrasound videos","","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A challenging task, in this context, is to segment the network of blood vessels. The blood vessel network runs all along the fundal image, varying in density and fineness of structure. Besides, changes in illumination, color and pathology also add to the difficulties in blood vessel segmentation. In this paper, we propose segmentation of blood vessels from fundal images in the deep learning framework, without any pre-processing. A deep convolutional network, consisting of 8 convolutional layers and 3 pooling layers in between, is used to achieve the segmentation. In this work, a Convolutional Neural Network currently in use for semantic image segmentation is customized for blood vessel segmentation by replacing the output layer with a convolutional layer of kernel size 1 √ó 1 which generates the final segmented image. The output of CNN is a gray scale image and is binarized by thresholding. The proposed method is applied on 2 publicly available databases DRIVE and HRF (capturing diversity in image resolution), consisting of healthy and diseased fundal images boosted by mirror versions of the originals. The method results in an accuracy of 93.94% and yields 0.894 as area under the ROC curve on the test data comprising of randomly selected 23 images from HRF dataset.

Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1131-5; POD:978-1-5090-1132-2","10.1109/RTSI.2016.7740576","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740576","Alzheimer's disease;Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Scalp EEG","Databases;Diseases;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Scalp;Standards;Time-frequency analysis","diseases;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets","AD progression;Alzheimer's disease patients;EEG classification;computational intelligence methodologies;convolutional-subsampling layers;deep convolutional neural networks;electroencephalography;healthy controls;machine learning approaches;mild cognitive impairment;multilayered feedforward perceptron;oscillatory brain rhythms;pathophysiological mechanism;scalp EEG recordings","","","","","","","","7-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to improvements in screening technologies, and an increased demand for their use, radiologists are required to analyze an ever increasing amount of image data, which can affect the quality of their diagnoses. Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) systems are designed to assist radiologists in this endeavor. Here, we present a CADe system for the detection of lung nodules in thoracic CT images. Our system is based on (1) the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI) database, which contains 1018 thoracic CT scans with nodules of different shape and size, and (2) a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained, using the back-propagation algorithm, to extract valuable volumetric features from the input data and detect lung nodules in sub-volumes of CT images. Considering only those test nodules that have been annotated by four radiologists, our CADe system achieves a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 78.9% with 20 false positives (FPs) per scan, or a sensitivity of 71.2% with 10 FPs per scan. This is achieved without using any segmentation or additional FP reduction procedures, both of which are commonly used in other CADe systems. Furthermore, our CADe system is validated on a larger number of lung nodules compared to other studies, which increases the variation in their appearance, and therefore, makes their detection by a CADe system more challenging.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727205","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727205","","Biological neural networks;Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Computed tomography;Image databases;Lungs","backpropagation;cancer;computerised tomography;feature extraction;medical image processing;neural nets;object detection;patient diagnosis;patient treatment","CADe systems;CNN;IDRI database;LIDC database;backpropagation algorithm;computer-aided detection system;deep convolutional neural network;deep convolutional neural networks;image data;image database resource initiative database;lung cancer diagnosis;lung cancer treatment;lung image database consortium database;lung nodule detection;screening technology;thoracic CT images;thoracic computed tomography scans;valuable volumetric feature extraction","","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, deep learning can extract and organize the discriminative information from the data, not requiring the design of feature extractors by a domain expert. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a particular type of deep, feedforward network that have gained attention from research community and industry, achieving empirical successes in tasks such as speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing and transfer learning. In this paper, we conduct some preliminary experiments using the deep learning approach to classify breast cancer histopathological images from BreaKHis, a publicly dataset available at http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. We propose a method based on the extraction of image patches for training the CNN and the combination of these patches for final classification. This method aims to allow using the high-resolution histopathological images from BreaKHis as input to existing CNN, avoiding adaptations of the model that can lead to a more complex and computationally costly architecture. The CNN performance is better when compared to previously reported results obtained by other machine learning models trained with hand-crafted textural descriptors.

Two principal factors make this task difficult: firstly, the presence of speckle noise arising from the interference that accompanies all coherent imaging approaches; secondly, the sometimes subtle interaction between musculoskeletal components that leads to non-uniformity of the image intensity. Our work presents an investigation of the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address both of these problems. CNNs are an effective tool that has previously been used in image processing of several biomedical imaging modalities. However, there is little published material addressing the processing of musculoskeletal ultrasound images. In our work we explore the effectiveness of CNNs when trained to act as a pre-segmentation pixel classifier that determines whether a pixel is an edge or non-edge pixel. Our CNNs are trained using two different ground truth interpretations. The first one uses an automatic Canny edge detector to provide the ground truth image; the second ground truth was obtained using the same image marked-up by an expert anatomist. In this initial study the CNNs have been trained using half of the prepared data from one image, using the other half for testing; validation was also carried out using three unseen ultrasound images. CNN performance was assessed using Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy. The results show that CNN performance when using expert ground truth image is better than using Canny ground truth image. Our technique is promising and has the potential to speed-up the image processing pipeline using appropriately trained CNNs.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727805","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727805","Convolutional Neural Networks;Musculoskeletal model;Segmentation;Ultrasound image","Biological system modeling;Biomedical imaging;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Kernel;Musculoskeletal system;Ultrasonic variables measurement","biomedical ultrasonics;bone;edge detection;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;muscle;neural nets;ultrasonic imaging","CNN performance;Mathew's correlation coefficient;automatic Canny edge detector;biomedical imaging modalities;convolutional neural network;edge pixel;expert ground truth image;ground truth images;ground truth interpretations;image intensity;image processing;image processing pipeline;musculoskeletal components;musculoskeletal ultrasound image segmentation;nonedge pixel;presegmentation pixel classifier;speckle noise","","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features are learned directly from the time domain ECG signals by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one fully connected layer. The learned features can replace the hand-crafted features and our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the learned features in patient screening. The experimental results indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an End-to-End convolutional neural network classifier. The major characteristics of the proposed approach are to simplify the process of feature extraction for different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to specify the appropriate features.

Here, we examine seizure prediction based on local field potentials (LFPs) from a small neocortical patch recorded via a 10√ó10 microelectrode array implanted in a patient with focal seizures. We formulate the seizure (ictal) prediction problem in terms of discriminating between interictal and preictal neural activity.

The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy.

Existing classification methods for X-ray images, however, generally represent the image using only local texture or generic image features (e.g. color or shape) derived from predefined feature spaces. This limits the ability to quantify the image characteristics using general data-derived features learned from image datasets. In this study we present a new algorithm to improve the performance of X-ray image classification, where we propose a late-fusion of domain transferred convolutional neural networks (DT-CNNs) with sparse spatial pyramid (SSP) features derived from a local image dictionary.

Some very recently proposed methods employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cells in H&E stained images. However, all such methods use some form of raw pixel intensities as input and rely on the CNN to learn the deep features. In this work, we extend a recently proposed spatially constrained CNN (SC-CNN) by proposing features that capture texture characteristics and show that although CNN produces good results on automatically learned features, it can perform better if the input consists of a combination of handcrafted features and the raw data. The handcrafted features are computed through the scattering transform which gives non-linear invariant texture features. The combination of handcrafted features with raw data produces sharp proximity maps and better detection results than the results of raw intensities with a similar kind of CNN architecture.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2349-6; POD:978-1-4799-2351-9","10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493441","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493441","Convolutional Neural Network;Digital Pathology;Scattering Transform;Tumor Nuclei Detection","Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Neural networks;Scattering;Standards;Transforms;Tumors","cellular biophysics;feature extraction;medical image processing;neural nets;tumours","cancer histology images;handcrafted features;nonlinear invariant texture features;scattering transform;spatially constrained convolutional neural networks;tumor cell detection","","","","13","","","","13-16 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The semantic level features are extracted by a CNN approach, which describe the proportions of nuclei belonging to the different grades, in conjunction with pixel-level (texture) and object-level (structure) features, to form an integrated set of attributes.

The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy?

Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 √ó3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric (0.88, 0.83, 0.77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall first position by the online evaluation platform.

Deep learning approaches have been shown to produce encouraging results on histopathology images in various studies. In this paper, we propose a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network (SC-CNN) to perform nucleus detection. SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the centers of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches.

While in many applications, the minority instances actually represent the concept of interest (e.g., fraud in banking operations, abnormal cell in medical data, etc.), a classifier induced from an imbalanced data set is more likely to be biased towards the majority class and show very poor classification accuracy on the minority class. Despite extensive research efforts, imbalanced data classification remains one of the most challenging problems in data mining and machine learning, especially for multimedia data. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose an extended deep learning approach to achieve promising performance in classifying skewed multimedia data sets. Specifically, we investigate the integration of bootstrapping methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with extensive empirical studies.

This paper studies the classification problem of the digestive organs for wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images aiming at saving the review time of doctors. Our previous study has proved the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based WCE classification system is able to achieve 95% classification accuracy in average, but it is difficult to further improve the classification accuracy owing to the variations of individuals and the complex digestive tract circumstance. Research shows that there are two possible approaches to improve classification accuracy: to extract more discriminative image features and to employ a more powerful classifier. In this paper, we propose to design a WCE classification system by a hybrid CNN with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In our approach, we construct the CNN as a data-driven feature extractor and the cascaded ELM as a strong classifier instead of the conventional used full-connection classifier in deep CNN classification system.

Segmentation needs to be accurate, efficient and robust to avoid influences caused by various large and complex biases added to images. This paper proposes a multiple convolutional neural network (CNNs) framework with discrimination mechanism which is effective to achieve these goals. First of all, this paper proposes to construct different triplanar 2D CNNs architecture for 3D voxel classification, greatly reducing segmentation time. Experiment is conducted on images provided by Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized by MICCAI 2013 for both training and testing. As T1, T1-enhanced, T2 and FLAIR MRI images are utilized, multimodal features are combined. As a result, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are comparable in comparison with manual gold standard images and better than state-of-the-art segmentation methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-0187-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-0188-0; POD:978-1-5090-0189-7","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2015.41","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415818","CNNs;brain tumor segmentation;voting strategy","Cancer;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Tumors","biomedical MRI;brain;computational geometry;computer vision;feedforward neural nets;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;tumours","3D voxel classification;BRATS;FLAIR MRI image utilization;MICCAI 2013;T1 image utilization;T1-enhanced image utilization;T2 image utilization;brain tumor diagnosis;brain tumor segmentation;computer vision;deep feature learning;discrimination mechanism;multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark;multiple convolutional neural network framework;segmentation time reduction;triplanar 2D CNN architecture","","","","14","","","","23-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2468589","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202837","Convolutional Neural Networks;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);Patient-specific ECG classification;patient-specific ECG classification;real-time heart monitoring","Databases;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Kernel;Monitoring;Neurons;Training","diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification","1D convolutional neural networks;ECG data stream;ECG records;Holter registers;MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database;classification performance;light-weight wearable device;patient-specific electrocardiogram classification system;patient-specific electrocardiogram monitoring system;patient-specific feature extraction;patient-specific training data;real-time ECG monitoring;real-time patient-specific ECG classification system;supraventricular ectopic beats","","12","","27","","","20150814","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274740","Deep convolutional neural network;nucleus segmentation;sparse representation","Breast cancer;Computational modeling;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Robustness;Shape;Tumors","cancer;diagnostic radiography;image segmentation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;probability;tumours","automated nucleus segmentation;automatic learning-based framework;automatic morphological feature computation;brain tumor;breast cancer;computer-aided image analysis;deep CNN model;deep convolutional neural network model;diseases;early detection;feature learning characteristic;high level shape prior modeling;histopathology imaging;histopathology specimens;iterative region merging approach;large-scale pathology image datasets;local repulsive deformable model;pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor;probability map;quantitative analysis;robust nucleus segmentation;robust selection-based sparse shape model;staining histopathology images;tissue","","7","","83","","","20150923","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One approach is based on the distance of image descriptors using the above features (hereon termed the ‚Äúdescriptor‚Äù-based approach); the second approach (‚Äúclassification‚Äù-based approach) is based on a probability descriptor, generated by a pair-wise classification of each two classes (pathologies) and their decision values using an SVM classifier. Best results are achieved using deep learning features in a classification scheme.","1094-687X;1094687X","DVD:978-1-4244-9270-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9271-8; POD:978-1-4244-9269-5","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319008","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319008","","Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Heart;Machine learning;Measurement;Pathology;Support vector machines","diagnostic radiography;image classification;image retrieval;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;probability;support vector machines","CNN;SVM classifier;X-ray image retrieval;binary features;binary texture;chest pathology retrieval;chest radiograph image retrieval;classification-based approach;decision values;deep learning classification;deep learning features;descriptor-based approach;image descriptors;pair-wise classification;probability descriptor;query image;texture features","","3","","12","","","","25-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another possibility is to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically extract an individual's best and most unique neural features and conduct classification, using EEG data derived from both Resting State with Open Eyes (REO) and Resting State with Closed Eyes (REC). Results indicate that this CNN-based joint-optimized EEG-based Biometric System yields a high degree of accuracy of identification (88%) for 10-class classification.

Classifying digestive organs in WCE images intuitively means to recognize higher semantic image features. To achieve this, an effective deep CNN-based WCE classification system has been constructed (DCNN-WCE-CS). With about 1 million real WCE images, intensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance by setting different network parameters. Results illustrate its superior performance compared to traditional classification methods, where about 95% classification accuracy can be achieved in average.

Each molecule can be represented by a unique neural connectivity problem (graph) which can be programmed onto a Cellular Neural Network. The idea was to translate chemical structures like small organic molecules or peptides into a self learning environment which is CNN based. In the case of small molecules, each cell of the CNN stands for one atom of the molecule under consideration. But in contrast to the standard CNN architecture where each cell is connected to the neighboring cells, only those cells of the feature net are connected for which there also exists a chemical bond in the molecule under consideration. This implies that the feature net topology varies from molecule to molecule. In the case of peptides, the amino acids that form the building blocks of the peptide are reflected by the CNN cells wherein the amino acid sequence defines the network topology. Unlike the standard CNN used for image processing, there are no input values like the input image that are fed into the feature net. Instead, all information about the input molecule is supplied to the feature net by means of the topology. The output of several feature nets is fed into a supervisor neural network which computes the final output value. The combination of several feature nets and a supervisor networks constitutes the Molecular Graph Network (MGN). The designed networks are used for selection of molecules representing wanted properties such as activity against specific diseases, interactions with other compounds, toxicity etc. and possibly being candidates to be tested further as new drugs.","0271-4302;02714302","Electronic:978-1-4799-8391-9; POD:978-1-4799-8392-6","10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168656","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7168656","","Amino acids;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Network topology;Peptides;Topology;Training","cellular neural nets;drugs;graph theory;medical computing;organic compounds;unsupervised learning","MGN;amino acid sequence;cellular neural network;chemical structures;drug design;feature nets;image processing;molecular graph network;network topology;neural connectivity problem;peptides;self learning environment;small organic molecules;standard CNN architecture;supervisor neural network","","0","","14","","","","24-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Exudates are the melted watery grasping solutes, proteins, cells, or cell garbage spilled from the harmed veins into near by tissues or on tissue surfaces in the retina. The spillage of these proteins or lipids causes vision misfortune to the patients. Distinguishing the exudates ahead of time can protect the diabetic patients from difficulty seeing.

The event-based vision sensor detects only changes in the scene, naturally responding to moving objects and ignoring static distracters in the background. We present operation of the system for two tasks. The first is proof of concept for a remote monitoring application in which the system tracks and distinguishes between cars, bikes, and pedestrians on a road. The second task targets application to grasp planning for an upper limb prosthesis and involves detecting and identifying household objects, as well as determining their orientation relative to the camera. The second task is used to quantify performance of the system, which can discriminate between 8 different objects in 2.25 ms with accuracy of 99.10% and is able to determine object orientation with -4.5¬∞ accuracy in an additional 2.28 ms with accuracy of 97.76%.","2163-4025;21634025","Electronic:978-1-4799-2346-5; POD:978-1-4799-2348-9","10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981783","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6981783","","Accuracy;Estimation;Neural networks;Real-time systems;Testing;Training;Visualization","biomedical telemetry;cameras;convolution;field programmable gate arrays;image sensors;medical image processing;neural nets;object recognition;object tracking;prosthetics","FPGA;convolutional neural network running;event-based camera;event-based vision sensor;grasp planning;real-time bioinspired system;real-time object orientation estimation;real-time object recognition;real-time object tracking;remote monitoring application;time 2.25 ms;upper limb prosthesis","","4","","8","","","","22-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The canny operator as well as the mathematical morphology method is used to detect and extract the GICS reading-window. Then, the test line and control line of the GICS reading-window are segmented by the cellular neural network (CNN) algorithm, where the template parameters of the CNN are designed by the switching particle swarm optimization (SPSO) algorithm for improving the performance of the CNN. It is shown that the SPSO-based CNN offers a robust method for accurately segmenting the test and control lines, and therefore serves as a novel image methodology for the interpretation of GICS. Furthermore, quantitative comparison is carried out among four algorithms in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio.

It is important that the anomaly detection algorithms are not confused by these objects. To achieve this goal, the authors propose an approach to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect chest tubes present on radiographs. To detect the chest tube skeleton as the final output in a better manner, non-uniform rational B-spline curves are used to automatically fit with the CNN output. This is the first study conducted to automatically detect artificial objects in the lung region of chest radiographs. Other automatic detection schemes work on the mediastinum. The authors evaluated the performance of the model using a pixel-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Each true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative pixel is counted and used for calculating average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity percentages. The results were 99.99% accuracy, 59% sensitivity and 99.99% specificity.

Establishing associated characteristics to certain stimulus in EEG is a monumental work due to complexity of the brain responses. For EEG classification several methods have been proposed. Among various statistical methods, Neural Networks (NN) have demonstrated capability in EEG classification using static and recurrent structures. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on Continuous Neural Networks (CNN). Such class of algorithm can handle the raw EEG signal. The method is divided in three stages, first the CNN is trained by using a part of a known database, secondly a parallel structure of the CNN is build with the weights obtained after training, third the parallel structure is tested with the rest of the database that was not used for the training process. All the previously mentioned process is developed by using the raw EEG signals presented on the database and introducing them directly to the CNN without any previously process.

The student can also see the cephalometric analysis performed by the instructor, thus obtaining an immediate feedback that stimulates self-reflection. Finally the tool allows for CNN applications that highlight anatomical regions and landmarks and eases their detection. The tool was used in several situations with and without embossing and with different monitor size. The impact of the tool in the learning process is evaluated by analysis of the software log. Analysis of the application log revealed statistics about the time spent for the identification of each landmark, the improvements in landmarking performance are measured as a decrease in the time needed for the overall analysis or as distance from the gold standard computed as mean expert landmark coordinates.

Cellular neural networks (CNNs) are massively parallel cellular structures with locally interconnected cells and learning abilities and offer efficient ways to perform many complex medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, the performance of two breast region segmentation methods based on conventional CNNs and multi-state CNNs have been compared using non fat-suppressed T2-weighted bilateral axial images selected from 23 healthy women examined using a 3 Tesla MR scanner.

Oddball paradigms are used in BCI to generate event-related potentials (ERPs), like the P300 wave, on targets selected by the user. A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300 waves allows the user to write characters. The P300 speller is composed of two classification problems. The first classification is to detect the presence of a P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The second one corresponds to the combination of different P300 responses for determining the right character to spell. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The topology of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 waves in the time domain. Seven classifiers based on the CNN are proposed: four single classifiers with different features set and three multiclassifiers. These models are tested and compared on the Data set II of the third BCI competition. The best result is obtained with a multiclassifier solution with a recognition rate of 95.5 percent, without channel selection before the classification.

BCIs are devices that process a user's brain signals to allow direct communication and interaction with the environment. BCIs bypass the normal neuromuscular output pathways and rely on digital signal processing and machine learning to translate brain signals to action (Figure 1). Historically, BCIs were developed with biomedical applications in mind, such as restoring communication in completely paralyzed individuals and replacing lost motor function. More recent applications have targeted nondisabled individuals by exploring the use of BCIs as a novel input device for entertainment and gaming. The task of the BCI is to identify and predict behaviorally induced changes or ""cognitive states"" in a user's brain signals. Brain signals are recorded either noninvasively from electrodes placed on the scalp [electroencephalogram (EEG)] or invasively from electrodes placed on the surface of or inside the brain. BCIs based on these recording techniques have allowed healthy and disabled individuals to control a variety of devices. In this article, we will describe different challenges and proposed solutions for noninvasive brain-computer interfacing.","1053-5888;10535888","","10.1109/MSP.2010.936774","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484181","","Brain computer interfaces;Cellular neural networks;Digital signal processing;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Machine learning;Neuromuscular;Scalp;Signal processing;Signal restoration","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;medical signal processing","EEG;brain signals;brain-computer interface;digital signal processing;electroencephalogram;machine learning;neuromuscular output pathways","","14","","7","","","","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms and assigns memberships to which are inversely related to the relative distance to the point prototypes that are cluster centers in the FCM model. In order to overcome the problem of outliers in data, several models including possibilistic c-means (PCM) and possibilistic-fuzzy c-means (PFCM) models have been proposed. In IFCM, a new measurement called intuition level is introduced so that the intuition level helps to alleviate the effect of noise. Several numerical examples are first used for experiments to compare the clustering performance of IFCM with those of FCM, PCM, and PFCM. A practical magnetic resonance image data set is then used for image segmentation experiment. Results show that IFCM compares favorably to several clustering algorithms including the SOM, FCM, CNN, PCM, and PFCM models. Since IFCM produces cluster prototypes less sensitive to outliers and to the selection of involved parameters than the other algorithms, IFCM is a good candidate for data clustering and image segmentation problems.","2162-9048;21629048","Electronic:978-1-4244-5943-8; POD:978-1-4244-5942-1","10.1109/ICISA.2010.5480541","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480541","","Cellular neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Image segmentation;Magnetic noise;Magnetic resonance;Magnetic resonance imaging;Noise level;Noise measurement;Phase change materials;Prototypes","fuzzy set theory;image segmentation;magnetic resonance imaging;medical image processing;pattern clustering;possibility theory","MRI segmentation;data clustering;intuitive fuzzy c-means;magnetic resonance image;possibilistic c-means;possibilistic-fuzzy c-means","","3","","23","","","","21-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Epileptic seizures are phenonema of abnormal synchronization of neural activity with symptoms like convulsions and generally strike without warning. Epileptic drugs, taken in the most important therapy, have the disadvantage of adverse effects and possible habituation. A reliably, automated seizure warning system would not only provide valuable information to the patient, but also enable an efficient, event specific therapy. The problem of detecting a possible pre-seizure state in epilepsy from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, has been addressed by many authors over the past decades but still remains unsolved. Provided that the transition between interictal state and the ictal event is not an abrupt phenomenon but a gradual change in dynamics [1], [2], precursors could be detected by analyzing brain electrical activity. Several publications report evidence that a preictal state can be detected in focal epilepsy by considering multi-variate measures [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] in particular, although seizures cannot be anticipated with necessary sensitivity and specificity up to now. In this contribution models based on CNN are considered in order to analyze signals from intracranial EEG, taking into account mutual dependencies between signals of neighboring electrodes. Due to their inherently parallel paradigm of computation and their high processing speed under real-time conditions combined with low power consumption, CNN are well suited to a great extent for the processing of multi-dimensional bio-electrical activity and a promising candidate for a future implantable seizure warning and preventing device. In the first proposed algorithm, solutions of Reaction-Diffusion CNN (RD-CNN) models are used in order to approximate short segments of EEG-signals. In a second - lgorithm, the behavior of linear spatio-temporal systems represented by discrete-time CNN (DT-CNN), are used for signal prediction of intracranial EEG. Results for the analysis of long-time recordings gained during presurgical diagnostics in temporal lobe epilepsy are given regardimg both algorithms and their predictive performance with respect to impending epileptic seizures is evaluated statistically. Additionally, the second above mentioned algorithm has been implemented on the Eyes-RIS 1.1 system [10], [11]. First results for the analysis of intracranial long-time recordings carried out on this system are given.","2165-0144;21650144","Electronic:978-1-4244-6680-1; POD:978-1-4244-6679-5","10.1109/CNNA.2010.5430287","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5430287","","Alarm systems;Brain modeling;Cellular neural networks;Drugs;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Event detection;Medical treatment;Nervous system;Particle measurements","cellular neural nets;electroencephalography;medical computing;neurophysiology","Eyes-RIS 1.1 system;automated seizure anticipation device;automated seizure warning system;cellular neural networks;discrete-time CNN;electroencephalogram signals;epileptic disorder;epileptic drugs;linear spatio-temporal systems;multidimensional bioelectrical activity;neural activity;presurgical diagnostics;reaction-diffusion CNN models;temporal lobe epilepsy","","0","","37","","","","3-5 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RD-CNN are determined in an identification process and then analyzed by means of Chuas Local Activity theory. Clinical manifestations of epileptic seizures are phenomena of abnormal, excessive, or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. The epileptic disorder is the most common chronic disorder of the central nervous system. Generally seizures appear without sign or warning and the problem of detecting a possible pre-seizure state in epilepsy from electroencephalogram (EEG) time series analysis has already been addressed in many publications. Up to now the identification of an impending epileptic seizure with sufficient specificity and reliability cannot be performed in an automated procedure. An algorithm for a reliable prediction of epileptic seizures would enable the realization of implantable seizure warning devices, which could provide valuable information to the patient and time/event specific drug delivery or direct electric nerve stimulation. CNN are characterized by local couplings of comparatively simple dynamical systems. With this property these networks are well suited to be realized as parallel, analog computing architectures. Recently developed CNN hardware realizations exhibit high parallel computing capacity together with low power consumption. Thus CNN platforms could provide a basis for future implantable seizure warning and preventing devices. In the proposed procedure, RD-CNN are considered for an identification of consecutive segments of intracranial EEG using supervised parameter optimization procedure. These networks are deduced from Reaction-Diffusion Systems, which are applied in different fields of science to describe various complex phenomena like nonlinear wave propagation or pattern formation. Especially, Chua derived the Local Activity - Theory, which provides a quantitative, necessary condition for emergent behavior in RD-CNN. The aim of these first investigations is to apply the Local Activity Theory to the networks obtained in the proposed identification procedure.

A CNN is a backpropagation neural network with two-dimensional (2-D) weight kernels that operate on images. A generalized, fast and stable implementation of the CNN was developed. The input images to the CNN were obtained from the ROI's using two techniques. The first technique employed averaging and subsampling. The second technique employed texture feature extraction methods applied to small subregions inside the ROI. Features computed over different subregions were arranged as texture images, which were subsequently used as CNN inputs. The effects of CNN architecture and texture feature parameters on classification accuracy were studied. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was used to evaluate the classification accuracy. A data set consisting of 168 ROIs containing biopsy-proven masses and 504 ROI's containing normal breast tissue was extracted from 168 mammograms by radiologists experienced in mammography. This data set was used for training and testing the CNN. With the best combination of CNN architecture and texture feature parameters, the area under the test ROC curve reached 0.87, which corresponded to a true-positive fraction of 90% at a false positive fraction of 31%.

Two major image patterns that are often targeted for extraction prior to further analyses are rounded and line objects. Here, the authors employed an enhanced Hough transform to extract both objects from the pre-defined image areas. This method can also be applied to the high frequency associated subbands of the wavelet domain where line objects are more distinct. Typically, rounded objects are associated with disease and need to be further analyzed. High intensity line objects are related to normal anatomical structures. Once the line objects are extracted and eliminated, a compensation process must be taken so that the modified pixels are filled by the gray value of the surrounding area. The authors used the ellipse extraction method to search for suspected lung nodules on chest radiographs. The line extraction method was used to detect the edge of ribs which can interfere with the final determination process analyzed by a convolution neural network (CNN). In this experiment, the authors found that the ellipse extraction method performed slightly better than the previous proposed profile matching method. The line removal technique, however, improved the performance of the convolution neural network by 4%. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) studies indicated that the convolution neural network can achieve a performance of Az=0.90 based on the authors' database when each suspected area was processed by the line removal technique","","POD:0-7803-2544-3","10.1109/NSSMIC.1994.474714","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=474714","","Anatomical structure;Computer aided diagnosis;Convolution;Diseases;Frequency;Image analysis;Lungs;Neural networks;Pattern analysis;Wavelet domain","Hough transforms;diagnostic radiography;image recognition;lung;medical image processing","chest radiographs;computer-aided diagnosis;convolution neural network;diseases;ellipse extraction method;enhanced Hough transform;high frequency associated subbands;line objects extraction;line removal technique;major image patterns;medical diagnostic imaging;medical image pattern recognition improvement;normal anatomical structure patterns;rib edge;rounded objects extraction;suspected lung nodules;wavelet domain","","0","7","10","","","","30 Oct-5 Nov 1994","30 Oct 1994-05 Nov 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The research efforts are aimed at increasing the ‚Äútrue-positive fraction‚Äù while decreasing the ‚Äúfalse-positive fraction‚Äù of the CADx. Among the problems of decreasing the number of false-positives, the differentiation between nodules and end-on vessels is one of the most challenging tasks performed by computers. Most investigators have used a conventional two-step pattern recognition approach, i.e., feature extraction followed by feature classification, The principal difficulty in those methodologies is in specifying the kind of features which will differentiate nodules from end-on vessels. Unfortunately, suitable feature definition, and corresponding extraction implementation algorithms, proved to be very difficult to define and specify. A convolution neural network (CNN) architecture, trained by direct connection to the raw image is proposed to tackle the problem. The CNN, which used locally responsive activation function, was directly and locally connected to the raw image. The performance of the CNN is evaluated in comparison to an expert radiologist.

In this research area the improvements in systems for clinical specular microscopy in vivo made a strong contribution to the study and the comprehension of the physiopathology of corneal endothelium. The more recent systems allow acquisition of the images and morphometric analysis. Nevertheless, the results (i.e. the automated reconstruction of the endothelium cell borders) are often inaccurate. Moreover, they do not allow the correct recognition of the cell shapes. On the other hand, even if the semiautomatic systems allow an effective evaluation of the cell shape, they are highly time consuming and provide results that could be affected by the criterion used by the operator in the cell corner detection.
