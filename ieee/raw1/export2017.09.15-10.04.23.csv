"Single Sensor Techniques for Sleep Apnea Diagnosis Using Deep Learning","R. K. Pathinarupothi; D. P. J; E. S. Rangan; G. E. A; V. R; K. P. Soman","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","20170914","2017","","","524","529","A large number of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cases are under-diagnosed due unavailability, inconvenience or expense of sleep labs. Hence, an automated detection by applying computational techniques to multivariate signals has already become a well-researched subject. However, the best-known techniques that use various features have not achieved the gold standard of polysomnography (PSG) tests. In this paper, we substantiate the medical conjecture that OSA directly impacts body parameters such as Instantaneous Heart Rate (IHR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). We then use a deep learning technique called LSTM-RNN (long short-term memory recurrent neural networks) to experimentally prove that OSA severity detection can be solely based on either IHR or SpO2 signals, which can be easily, obtained using off-the-shelf non-intrusive wearable single sensors. The results obtained from LSTM-RNN model shows an area under curve (AUC) of 0.98 associated with very high accuracy on a dataset of more than 16,000 apnea non-apnea minutes. These results have encouraged our collaborating doctors to further come up with a diagnostic protocol that is based on LSTM-RNN, SpO2, and IHR, thereby increasing the chances of larger adoption among medical community.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4881-6; POD:978-1-5090-4882-3","10.1109/ICHI.2017.37","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031206","Instantaneous Heart Rate and SpO2;LSTM-RNN;Obstructive sleep apnea","Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sleep apnea;Time series analysis","","","","","","","","","","23-26 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People often talk about their experiences and opinions on different health-related issues e.g. they write reviews on medications, describe symptoms and ask informal questions about various health concerns. Due to the colloquial nature of the languages used in the social media, it is often difficult for an automated system to accurately interpret them for appropriate clinical understanding. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for medical concept normalization of user-generated texts to map a health condition described in the colloquial language to a medical concept defined in standard clinical terminologies. We use multiple deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with input word embeddings trained on various clinical domain-specific knowledge sources. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed models can achieve up to 21.28% accuracy improvements over the existing models when we use the combination of all knowledge sources to learn neural embeddings.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4881-6; POD:978-1-5090-4882-3","10.1109/ICHI.2017.59","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031195","deep learning;medical concept normalization;social media","Drugs;Hair;Hidden Markov models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pain;Recurrent neural networks;Social network services","","","","","","","","","","23-26 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There often exist missing parts in medical examination data due to various human factors, for instance, because human subjects occasionally miss their annual examinations. Such missing parts make it hard to predict the future examination data by machines. Thus, imputation of the missing information is needed for accurate prediction of medical examination data. Among various types of RNNs, we choose simple recurrent network (SRN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the missing information as well as the future medical examination data, as they show good performance in many relevant applications. In our proposed method, the temporal trajectories of the medical examination measurements are modeled by RNNs with the missed measurements compensated, which is then used to predict the future measurements to be used as diagnosing the diseases of the subjects in advance. We have carried out experiments using a medical examination database of Korean people for 12 consecutive years with 13 medical fields. In this database, 11500 people took the medical check-up every year, and 7400 people missed their examination occasionally. We use complete data to train RNNs, and the data with missing parts are used to evaluate the imputation and future measurement prediction performance. In terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and source to noise ratio (SNR) between the prediction and the actual measurements, the experimental results show that the proposed RNNs predicts medical examination data much better than the conventional linear regression in most of the examination items.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3015-6; POD:978-1-5090-3016-3; USB:978-1-5090-3014-9","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881685","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881685","long short-term memory;medical examination data prediction;recurrent neural network","Diseases;Linear regression;Logic gates;Medical diagnostic imaging;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;recurrent neural nets","Korea;LSTM;RMSE;RNN training;SNR;SRN;disease diagnosis;human factors;long short-term memory;measurement prediction performance evaluation;medical examination data prediction;medical examination database;medical examination measurements;missing information imputation;missing parts;recurrent neural networks;root mean squared error;simple-recurrent network;source-to-noise ratio;temporal trajectories","","","","","","","","13-16 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most studies for predicting prognosis have used complex data from patients such as biomedical images, biomarkers, and pathological measurements. We demonstrate a language model-like method for predicting high-risk prognosis from diagnosis histories of patients using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., prognosis prediction using RNN (PP-RNN). The proposed PP-RNN uses multiple RNNs for learning from diagnosis code sequences of patients in order to predict occurrences of high-risk diseases. The use of RNNs allows the model to learn the status changes of patients considering time, thus enhancing prediction accuracy. We evaluate our method on real-world diagnosis data of over 67,000 adult disease patients recorded for 14 years. Experimental results show the proposed PP-RNN outperforms other standard classification models. In particular, our method provides competitive performance with respect to recall and F1-score on high-risk diseases compared to other models.

Accurate acquisition of fetal standard planes with key anatomical structures is very crucial for substantial biometric measurement and diagnosis. However, the standard plane acquisition is a labor-intensive task and requires operator equipped with a thorough knowledge of fetal anatomy. Therefore, automatic approaches are highly demanded in clinical practice to alleviate the workload and boost the examination efficiency. The automatic detection of standard planes from US videos remains a challenging problem due to the high intraclass and low interclass variations of standard planes, and the relatively low image quality. Unlike previous studies which were specifically designed for individual anatomical standard planes, respectively, we present a general framework for the automatic identification of different standard planes from US videos. Distinct from conventional way that devises hand-crafted visual features for detection, our framework explores in- and between-plane feature learning with a novel composite framework of the convolutional and recurrent neural networks. To further address the issue of limited training data, a multitask learning framework is implemented to exploit common knowledge across detection tasks of distinctive standard planes for the augmentation of feature learning.

In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method that encapsulates the multi-channel neurophysiological signals into grid-like frames through wavelet and scalogram transform. We further design a hybrid deep learning model that combines the `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)' and `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)', for extracting task-related features, mining inter-channel correlation and incorporating contextual information from those frames.

The influences of taken insulin on plasma insulin concentration, as well as the effect of food intake on glucose input into the blood from the gut, are estimated from the CMs. The outputs of CMs, along with previous glucose measurements, are fed to a NN, which provides short-term prediction of glucose values. For comparative reasons two different NN architectures have been tested: a Feed-Forward NN (FFNN) trained with the back-propagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate and momentum, and a Recurrent NN (RNN), trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The results indicate that the best prediction performance can be achieved by the use of RNN","1557-170X;1557170X","CD:1-4244-003303; Paper:1-4244-0032-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260640","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4462562","","Artificial neural networks;Biochemistry;Collision mitigation;Databases;Diabetes;Insulin;Monitoring;Neural networks;Recurrent neural networks;Sugar","backpropagation;biomedical measurement;diseases;feedforward neural nets;medical computing;paediatrics;recurrent neural nets;sugar","RNN;adaptive learning rate;artificial neural network;back-propagation algorithm;compartmental models;feed-forward NN;food intake;glucose monitoring system;glucose-insulin metabolism model;plasma insulin concentration;real time recurrent learning algorithm;recurrent NN;type 1 diabetes","Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Blood Glucose;Child;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Glucose;Humans;Insulin;Mathematics;Models, Biological;Neural Networks (Computer)","12","","","","","","Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proven to be very successful for modelling sequences of data in many areas of Machine Learning. In this work we present an approach based on RNNs, specifically designed for the clinical domain, that combines static and dynamic information in order to predict future events. We work with a database collected in the Charité Hospital in Berlin that contains complete information concerning patients that underwent a kidney transplantation. After the transplantation three main endpoints can occur: rejection of the kidney, loss of the kidney and death of the patient. Our goal is to predict, based on information recorded in the Electronic Health Record of each patient, whether any of those endpoints will occur within the next six or twelve months after each visit to the clinic. We compared different types of RNNs that we developed for this work, with a model based on a Feedforward Neural Network and a Logistic Regression model. We found that the RNN that we developed based on Gated Recurrent Units provides the best performance for this task. We also used the same models for a second task, i.e., next event prediction, and found that here the model based on a Feedforward Neural Network outperformed the other models. Our hypothesis is that long-term dependencies are not as relevant in this task.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6117-4; POD:978-1-5090-6118-1","10.1109/ICHI.2016.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776332","","Diseases;Kidney;Medical diagnostic imaging;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks","electronic health records;feedforward neural nets;hospitals;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis","Berlin;Charite Hospital;RNN;clinical data sets;clinical event prediction;data sequences;dynamic information;electronic health record;feedforward neural network;gated recurrent units;logistic regression model;machine learning;patient information;recurrent neural networks;static information","","","","","","","","4-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is extensively used in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and can be used for disease diagnosis, disease treatment, etc. The two main technologies of EEG signal analysis is feature extraction and pattern recognition. The key features of EEG signals can be obtained through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The wavelet analysis is one kind of time-frequency analysis and has been considered very promising for data compression. The conventional method find wavelet synopsis to minimize the total mean squared error (L2). It cannot control the approximation error of each single data element in the data vector. Usually, the nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linears, also more time-consuming in the meantime. In this paper, one method is provided to realize the feature extraction and pattern recognition of EEG signals. The data compression algorithm Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) proposed by Pang et al. takes a novel method to construct unrestricted Haar wavelet synopsis under uniform norm (L∞) error bound. In their algorithm, the maximum approximation error of each individual element can be bounded by an given error bound. We apply this method to EEG signal compression, thus the key features are obtained. Then a fast nonlinear classification algorithm, one Randomize Neural Network (RNN), is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals. The experiments indicate that (1) the F-Shift algorithm can compress EEG signals effectively and obtain the key features at the same time and (2) the RNN can discriminate different patterns of EEG signals based on the extracted features.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7678-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7679-2; POD:978-1-4673-7680-8","10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378121","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378121","Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis;Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) algorithm;Randomize Neural Network (RNN);Signal compression","Approximation algorithms;Biological neural networks;Data compression;Diseases;Electroencephalography;Signal processing algorithms;Wavelet transforms","Haar transforms;brain-computer interfaces;data compression;diseases;electroencephalography;feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;mean square error methods;medical signal processing;neural nets;time-domain analysis;wavelet transforms","BCI;Brain-Computer Interface system;EEG signal analysis;EEG signal compression;F-Shift algorithm;Haar wavelet synopsis;RNN;Randomize Neural Network;biomedical domain;data compression algorithm;data vector;disease diagnosis;disease treatment;electroencephalogram signals;fast nonlinear classification algorithm;feature extraction;fixed-value shift compression algorithm;frequency-domain analysis;maximum approximation error;nonlinear classification algorithms;pattern recognition;single data element;time-domain analysis;time-frequency analysis;total mean squared error;uniform norm error bound;wavelet analysis","","","","16","","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most temporal inference methods for the dynamics of GRNs assume linear dependencies among genes but this strong assumption of linearity among genes does not truly represent the dynamics of the GRNs which are inherently nonlinear. Other parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems such as the S-systems and causal identification structure (CSI) have been proposed for modeling time-course nonlinearities in GRNs; however, these methods are statistically inefficient and analytically intractable especially in high dimensions. To overcome these problems, we propose an algorithm based on optimized recurrent neural network (RNN) and dynamic Bayesian (DBN) network called RNN-DBN. The inference algorithm for our DBN is based on nonlinear state space Elman recurrent neural network. Results on Drosophila Melanogaster nonlinear time-course benchmark dataset shows our method outperforms the G1DBN inference method based on linear model assumptions. The algorithm is further applied to time-course ovarian cancer dataset. The results show that the expression levels of three of five significant hub genes (flap structure-specific endonuclease 1, kinesin family member 11 and CDC6 cell division cycle 6 homolog (S. cerevisiae)) were decreased by oxaliplatin, but remained constant with cisplatin platinum drugs.

Three methods for model fusion are presented and comparatively assessed. Data from 23 T1D subjects under sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy were used in two adaptive data-driven models (an autoregressive model with output correction - cARX, and a recurrent neural network - RNN). Data fusion techniques based on i) Dempster-Shafer Evidential Theory (DST), ii) Genetic Algorithms (GA), and iii) Genetic Programming (GP) were used to merge the complimentary performances of the prediction models. The fused output is used in a warning algorithm to issue alarms of upcoming hypo-/hyperglycemic events. The fusion schemes showed improved performance with lower root mean square errors, lower time lags, and higher correlation. In the warning algorithm, median daily false alarms (DFA) of 0.25%, and 100% correct alarms (CA) were obtained for both event types. The detection times (DT) before occurrence of events were 13.0 and 12.1 min respectively for hypo-/hyperglycemic events.

Human characteristics are basically subject specific and time variant; for instance, neuromuscular dynamics may vary due to muscle fatigue. To tackle such patient specificity and time-varying characteristics, a robust bio-signal processing and a precise model-based control which can manage the nonlinearity and time variance of the system, would bring break-through and new modality toward computational intelligence (CI) based rehabilitation technology and personalized neuroprosthetics. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a useful technique to assist restoring motor capability of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients by delivering electrical pulses to paralyzed muscles. However, muscle fatigue constraints the application of FES as it results in the time-variant muscle response. To perform adaptive closedloop FES control with actual muscle response feedback taken into account, muscular torque is essential to be estimated accurately. However, inadequacy of the implantable torque sensor limits the direct measurement of the time-variant torque at the joint. This motivates the development of methods to estimate muscle torque from bio-signals that can be measured. Evoked electromyogram (eEMG) has been found to be highly correlated with FES-induced torque under various muscle conditions, indicating that it can be used for torque/force prediction. A nonlinear ARX (NARX) type model is preferred to track the relationship between eEMG and stimulated muscular torque. This paper presents a NARX recurrent neural network (NARX-RNN) model for identification/prediction of FES-induced muscular dynamics with eEMG. The NARX-RNN model may possess novelty of robust prediction performance. Due to the difficulty of choosing a proper forgetting factor of Kalman filter for predicting time-variant torque with eEMG, the presente- NARX-RNN could be considered as an alternative muscular torque predictor. Data collected from five SCI patients is used to evaluate the proposed NARX-RNN model, and the results show promising estimation performances. In addition, the general importance regarding CI-based motor function modeling is introduced along with its potential impact in the rehabilitation domain. The issue toward personalized neuroprosthetics is discussed in detail with the potential role of CI-based identification and the benefit for motor-impaired patient community.","1556-603X;1556603X","","10.1109/MCI.2014.2307224","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786477","","Communities;Computational intelligence;Computational modeling;Electromyography;Fatigue;Motion control;Muscles;Patient rehabilitation;Predictive models;Prosthetics;Recurrent neural networks;Torque measurement","Kalman filters;adaptive control;closed loop systems;control nonlinearities;electromyography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;prosthetics;recurrent neural nets","CI-based motor function modeling;FES-induced torque;Kalman filter;NARX recurrent neural network model;NARX-RNN model;adaptive closed-loop FES control;computational intelligence based rehabilitation technology;electrical pulses;evoked EMG;evoked electromyogram;model-based control;motor-impaired patient community;muscle fatigue tracking;muscle response feedback;neurological disorder;neuromuscular dynamics;nonlinear ARX type model;paralyzed muscles;personalized neuroprosthetics;robust biosignal processing;spinal cord injured patients;stimulated muscular torque;system nonlinearity;system time variance;time-variant torque","","19","","35","","","","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To improve the computational requirements of the EKF, Puskorius proposed the decoupled EKF (DEKF) as a practical remedy for the proper management of computational resources. This approach, however, sacrifices computational accuracy of estimates because it ignores the interactions between the estimates of mutually exclusive weights. To overcome such a limitation, therefore, we proposed hybrid implementation based on EKF (HEKF) for respiratory motion estimation, which uses the channel number for the mutually exclusive groups and the coupling technique to compensate the computational accuracy. Moreover, the authors restricted to a DEKF algorithm in which the weights connecting the inputs to a node are grouped together. If there are multiple input training sequences with respect to the time stamp, the complexity can increase by the power of the input channel number. To improve the computational complexity, we split the complicated neural network into a couple of simple neural networks to adjust separate input channels. The experimental results validated that the prediction overshoot of the proposed HEKF was improved by 62.95% in the average prediction overshoot values. The proposed HEKF showed a better performance of 52.40% improvement in the average of the prediction time horizon. We have evaluated that the proposed HEKF can outperform DEKF by comparing the prediction overshoot values, the performance of the tracking estimation value, and the normalized root-mean-squared error.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2158046","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5778976","Estimate;extended Kalman filter (EKF);multilayer perceptron (MLP);recurrent neural network (RNN);tracking","Covariance matrix;Kalman filters;Neural networks;Nonlinear systems;Recurrent neural networks","Kalman filters;medical signal processing;motion estimation;neural nets;nonlinear filters","DEKF algorithm;HEKF;computational complexity;computational requirements;coupling technique;decoupled EKF;extended Kalman filter;hybrid implementation;input-output mappings;normalized root-mean-squared error;respiratory motion estimation;tracking estimation value;training nonlinear neural networks","","11","","64","","","20110527","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We adopt a computational intelligence approach comprising swarm intelligence techniques, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). In addition, the recurrent neural network (RNN) formalism is employed for modeling the dynamical behavior of gene regulatory systems. More specifically, ACO is used for searching the discrete space of network architectures and PSO for searching the corresponding continuous space of RNN model parameters. We propose a novel solution construction process in the context of ACO for generating biologically plausible candidate architectures. The objective is to concentrate the search effort into areas of the structure space that contain architectures which are feasible in terms of their topological resemblance to real-world networks. The proposed framework is initially applied to the reconstruction of a small artificial network that has previously been studied in the context of gene network reverse engineering. Subsequently, we consider an artificial data set with added noise for reconstructing a subnetwork of the genetic interaction network of S. cerevisiae (yeast). Finally, the framework is applied to a real-world data set for reverse engineering the SOS response system of the bacterium Escherichia coli.

Although EEG is an obvious quantitative parameter related to the illness, it's limitation is the absence of an identified set of features that discriminates AD EEG abnormalities from those due to confounding conditions. As a consequence, no computerized method exists up to date that can reliably detect those abnormalities. The objective of this study is to develop a robust computerized method for early detection of AD in EEG. The authors explore the ability of specifically designed and trained recurrent neural network (RNN), combined with wavelet preprocessing, to discriminate between EEGs of early onset AD patients and age-matched control subjects. The RNNs are chosen because they can implement extremely nonlinear decision boundaries and possess memory of the state which is crucial for the considered task. The results on eyes-closed resting EEG reveal particularly favorable network behavior when applied to wavelet filtered subbands as opposed to original signal data","1094-687X;1094687X","POD:0-7803-5674-8","10.1109/IEMBS.1999.804351","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=804351","","Alzheimer's disease;Computer network reliability;Delay;Electroencephalography;Laboratories;Neural networks;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Recurrent neural networks;Testing;Wavelet transforms","diseases;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;recurrent neural nets;wavelet transforms","3.6 y;Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;EEG analysis;abnormalities detection;age-matched control subjects;clinical symptomatology;computerized method;electrodiagnostics;extremely nonlinear decision boundaries;eyes-closed resting EEG;illness;lifetime accuracy;mean diagnostic delay;nonlinear decision boundaries;particularly favorable network behavior;symptomatic onset;wavelet filtered subbands;wavelet preprocessing","","0","","2","","","","Oct 1999","13 Oct 1999-16 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A specific DWT, based on the cubic spline wavelet, produces a set of wavelet coefficients from coarse to fine scale levels. The RNN has its current output fed back to its input nodes, forming a nonlinear autoregressive model for predicting future wavelet coefficients. A predicted trend signal is obtained by constructing the interpolation function from the predicted wavelet coefficients at the coarsest scale level, V<sub>0</sub>. This method has been applied to intracranial pressure data collected from head trauma patients in the intensive care unit. The method has been shown to be more efficient than one which uses raw data to train the RNN","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-2431-5","10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479705","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479705","","Biomedical monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms;Interpolation;Iterative closest point algorithm;Multiresolution analysis;Neural networks;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Spline;Wavelet coefficients","autoregressive processes;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;patient care;prediction theory;recurrent neural nets;splines (mathematics);time series;wavelet transforms","coarsest scale leve;cubic spline wavelet;discrete wavelet transform;head trauma patients;input nodes;intensive care unit;interpolation function;intracranial pressure data;nonlinear autoregressive model;predicted trend signal;recurrent neural networks;time series modeling;time series prediction;wavelet coefficients","","3","","5","","","","9-12 May 1995","09 May 1995-12 May 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
