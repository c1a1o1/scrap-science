Currently, the main stream low-dose CT methods include vendor-specific sinogram domain filtration and iterative reconstruction algorithms, but they need to access raw data whose formats are not transparent to most users. Due to the difficulty of modeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing methods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image noise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, here we combine the autoencoder, deconvolution network, and shortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the proposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to the-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases. Especially, our method has been favorably evaluated in terms of noise suppression, structural preservation, and lesion detection.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2715284","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947200","Low-dose CT;auto-encoder;convolutional;deconvolutional;deep learning;residual neural network","Computed tomography;Convolution;Decoding;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;X-ray imaging","","","","","","","","","20170613","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We have combined an iterative learning approach and an encoder-decoder network to improve segmentation results, which enables to precisely localize the regions of interest (ROIs) including complex shapes or detailed textures of medical images in an iterative manner. The proposed iterative deep convolutional encoder-decoder network consists of two main paths: convolutional encoder path and convolutional decoder path with iterative learning. Experimental results show that the proposed iterative deep learning framework is able to yield excellent medical image segmentation performances for various medical images. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been proved by comparing with other state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2809-2; POD:978-1-5090-2810-8","10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036917","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036917","","","","","","","","","","","","11-15 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A regularized deep learning approach for clinical risk prediction of acute coronary syndrome using electronic health records","Z. Huang; W. Dong; H. Duan; J. Liu","College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China 310008 (e-mail: zhengxing.h@gmail.com)","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Objective: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as a common and severe cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death and the principal cause of serious long-term disability globally. Clinical risk prediction of ACS is important for early intervention and treatment. Existing ACS risk scoring models are based mainly on a small set of hand-picked risk factors and often dichotomize predictive variables to simplify the score calculation [1-3]. Methods: This study develops a regularized stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) model to stratify clinical risks of ACS patients from a large volume of electronic health records (EHR). To capture characteristics of patients at similar risk levels, and preserve the discriminating information across different risk levels, two constraints are added on SDAE to make the reconstructed feature representations contain more risk information of patients, which contribute to a better clinical risk prediction result. Results: We validate our approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 3,464 ACS patient samples. The performance of our approach for predicting ACS risk remains robust and reaches 0.868 and 0.73 in terms of both AUC and Accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: The obtained results show that the proposed approach achieves a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in dealing with the clinical risk prediction problem. In addition, our approach can extract informative risk factors of ACS via a reconstructive learning strategy. Some of these extracted risk factors are not only consistent with existing medical domain knowledge, but also contain suggestive hypotheses that could be validated by further investigations in the medical domain.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2731158","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990180","Acute coronary syndrome;Clinical risk prediction;Deep learning;Electronic Health Record;Stacked denoising auto-encoder","","","","","","","","","","20170724","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
