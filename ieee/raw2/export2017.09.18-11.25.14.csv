"HCNN: Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Networks for Comorbid Risk Prediction with Electronic Health Records","J. Zhang; J. Gong; L. Barnes","Dept. of Syst. & Inf. Eng., Univ. of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA","2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)","20170817","2017","","","214","221","The increasing adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has brought tremendous opportunities in medicine enabling more personalized prognostic models. However, most work to date has investigated the binary classification problem for predicting the onset of one chronic disease, but little attention has been given to assessing risk of developing comorbidities that are major causes of morbidity and mortality. For example, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease frequently accompany congestive heart failure. This paper is motivated by the problem of predicting comorbid diseases and aims to answer the following question: can we predict the comorbid risk using a patient's medical history? We propose a new predictive learning framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), that represents EHRs as graphs with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, and medication), and then develop a novel deep learning methodology for risk prediction of multiple comorbid diseases. The main innovation of the framework is that it defines the distance between the heterogeneous attributes of the graph representation extracted from the EHR and develops an appropriate learning infrastructure that is a composition of sparse convolutional layers and local pooling steps that match with the local structure of the space of the heterogeneous attributes. As a result, the new method is capable of capturing features about the relationships between heterogeneous attributes of the graphs. Through a comparative study on patient EHR data, HCNN achieves better performance than traditional convolutional neural networks on the risk prediction of comorbid diseases.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4722-2; POD:978-1-5090-4723-9; USB:978-1-5090-4721-5","10.1109/CHASE.2017.80","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010635","Electronic Health Records;Heterogeneous Convolution;Neural Networks;Risk Prediction","Convolution;Correlation;Diseases;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Neural networks","diseases;electronic health records;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;risk management","EHR systems;HCNN;binary classification problem;chronic disease;comorbid diseases;comorbid risk prediction;deep learning methodology;electronic health records;graph representation;heterogeneous attributes;heterogeneous convolutional neural networks;learning infrastructure;local pooling steps;personalized prognostic models;predictive learning framework;sparse convolutional layers","","","","","","","","17-19 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distinguished from previous studies, our approach embraces a double-annotated dataset and strays away from obscure “black-box” models to comprehensive deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel neural attention mechanism that not only classifies clinically important findings. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention analysis are used to classify radiology head computed tomography reports based on five categories that radiologists would account for in assessing acute and communicable findings in daily practice. The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset. Our attention analysis demonstrates the intuition behind the classifier's decision by generating a heatmap that highlights attended terms used by the CNN model; this is valuable when potential downstream medical decisions are to be performed by human experts or the classifier information is to be used in cohort construction such as for epidemiological studies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6182-2; POD:978-1-5090-6183-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966408","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966408","","Computational modeling;Convolution;Machine learning;Neural networks;Radiology;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines","computerised tomography;convolution;data analysis;electronic health records;neural nets;pattern classification;radiology","CNN;EHR;attention analysis;convolutional neural networks;double-annotated dataset;electronic health record;neural attention mechanism;neural attention models;radiology head computed tomography reports classification","","","","","","","","14-19 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A regularized deep learning approach for clinical risk prediction of acute coronary syndrome using electronic health records","Z. Huang; W. Dong; H. Duan; J.

Clinical risk prediction of ACS is important for early intervention and treatment. Existing ACS risk scoring models are based mainly on a small set of hand-picked risk factors and often dichotomize predictive variables to simplify the score calculation [1-3]. Methods: This study develops a regularized stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) model to stratify clinical risks of ACS patients from a large volume of electronic health records (EHR). To capture characteristics of patients at similar risk levels, and preserve the discriminating information across different risk levels, two constraints are added on SDAE to make the reconstructed feature representations contain more risk information of patients, which contribute to a better clinical risk prediction result. Results: We validate our approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 3,464 ACS patient samples. The performance of our approach for predicting ACS risk remains robust and reaches 0.868 and 0.73 in terms of both AUC and Accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: The obtained results show that the proposed approach achieves a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in dealing with the clinical risk prediction problem. In addition, our approach can extract informative risk factors of ACS via a reconstructive learning strategy. Some of these extracted risk factors are not only consistent with existing medical domain knowledge, but also contain suggestive hypotheses that could be validated by further investigations in the medical domain.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2731158","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990180","Acute coronary syndrome;Clinical risk prediction;Deep learning;Electronic Health Record;Stacked denoising auto-encoder","","","","","","","","","","20170724","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Measuring Patient Similarities via a Deep Architecture with Medical Concept Embedding","Z. Zhu; C. Yin; B. Qian; Y. Cheng; J. Wei; F.

Aproper patient similarity measure enables various downstream applications, such as cohort study and treatment comparative effectiveness research. One major carrier for conducting patient similarity research is the Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are usually heterogeneous, longitudinal, and sparse. Though existing studies on learning patient similarity from EHRs have shown being useful in solving real clinical problems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medical interpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume a vector based representation for patients, which typically requires aggregation of medical events over a certain time period. As aconsequence, the temporal information will be lost. In this paper, we propose a patient similarity evaluation framework based on temporal matching of longitudinal patient EHRs. Two efficient methods are presented, unsupervised and supervised, both of which preserve the temporal properties in EHRs. The supervised scheme takes a convolutional neural network architecture, and learns an optimal representation of patient clinical records with medical concept embedding. The empirical results on real-world clinical data demonstrate substantial improvement over the baselines.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5473-2; POD:978-1-5090-5474-9","10.1109/ICDM.2016.0086","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837899","Deep Matching;Medical Concept Embedding;Patient Similarity","Context;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Natural language processing;Neural networks","electronic health records;health care;patient care;pattern matching;unsupervised learning","EHR;clinical similarities;convolutional neural network architecture;deep architecture;electronic health records;healthcare informatics;medical concept embedding;medical interpretations;patient similarity evaluation;patient similarity measurement;patient similarity research;real-world clinical data;temporal longitudinal patient EHR matching;vector based representation","","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
