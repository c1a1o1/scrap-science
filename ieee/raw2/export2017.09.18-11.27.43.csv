Microaneurysms (MAs), due to leakage from retina blood vessels, are the early signs of DR. However, automated MA detection is complicated because of the small size of MA lesions and the low contrast between the lesion and its retinal background. Recently deep learning (DL) strategies have been used for automatic feature extraction and classification problems, especially for image analysis. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a DL strategy, is presented for MA detection in fundus images. Small image patches are generated from the original fundus images. The SSAE learns high-level features from pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of MA. The high-level features learned by SSAE are fed into a classifier to categorize each image patch as MA or non-MA. The public benchmark DIARETDB is utilized to provide the training/testing data and ground truth. Among the 89 images, totally 2182 image patches with MA lesions, serve as positive data, and another 6230 image patches without MA lesions are generated by a randomly sliding window operation, to serve as negative data. Without any blood vessel removal or complicated preprocessing operations, SSAE learned directly from the raw image patches, and automatically extracted the distinguishing features to classify the patches using Softmax Classifier. By employing the fine-tuning operation, an improved F-measure 91.3% and an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) 96.2% were achieved using 10-fold cross-validation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0943-5; POD:978-1-5090-0944-2","10.1109/CHASE.2016.12","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545864","automated microaneurysm detection;deep learning;diabetic retinopathy;feature representation;stacked sparse autoencoder","Biomedical image processing;Conferences;Feature extraction;Lesions;Machine learning","blood vessels;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","10-fold cross-validation;DIARETDB public benchmark;DR;F-measure;SSAE;automated MA detection;automatic feature extraction;blindness;classification problems;deep learning method;diabetic retinopathy;fine-tuning operation;fundus images;image analysis;microaneurysm detection;microaneurysms;randomly sliding window operation;retina blood vessels;softmax classifier;stacked sparse autoencoder;working-age population","","1","","","","","","27-29 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The location information from the first stage is then used to perform fine-grained segmentation of the fovea region in the second stage. The proposed method performs end-to-end pixelwise segmentation by creating a deep learning model based on fully convolutional neural networks, which does not require the prior knowledge of the location of other retinal structures such as optic disc (OD) and vasculature geometry.

Deep Learning models have recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art in several fields, since they can learn features with multiple levels of abstraction from the data itself. However, these methods can easily fall into overfitting, since a huge number of parameters must be learned. Having bigger datasets may act as regularization and lead to better models. Yet, acquiring and manually annotating images, especially in the medical field, can be a long and costly procedure. Hence, when using regular datasets, people heavily need to apply artificial data augmentation. In this work, we use a fully convolutional neural network capable of reaching the state-of-the-art. Also, we investigate the benefits of augmenting data with new samples created by warping retinal fundus images with nonlinear transformations.

In order to make reliable judgments for clinical usage, accurate and robust segmentation methods are needed. Due to the high complexity of biological vasculature trees, manual identification is often too time-consuming and tedious to be used in practice. To design an automated and computerized method, a major challenge is that the appearance of vasculatures in medical images has great variance across modalities and subjects. Therefore, most existing approaches are specially designed for a particular task, lacking the flexibility to be adapted to other circumstances. In this paper, we present a generic approach for vascular structure identification from medical images, which can be used for multiple purposes robustly. The proposed method uses the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the appearance features of the target. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based nearest neighbor search is then utilized to estimate the local structure distribution, which is further incorporated within the generalized probabilistic tracking framework to extract the entire connected tree. Qualitative and quantitative results over retinal fundus data demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable accuracy as compared with state-of-the-art methods, while efficiently producing more information regarding the candidate tree structure.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2349-6; POD:978-1-4799-2351-9","10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493520","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493520","Deep Learning;Generalized Probabilistic Tracking;Nearest Neighbor Search;Principal Component Analysis;Vascular Structure","Biomedical imaging;Dictionaries;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Robustness","","","","1","","10","","","","13-16 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In medical image analysis tasks, the majority of training examples are easy to classify and therefore contribute little to the CNN learning process. In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the CNN training for medical image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images. A decreased training time from 170 epochs to 60 epochs with an increased performance-on par with two human experts-was achieved with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.894 and 0.972 on two data sets.

A challenging task, in this context, is to segment the network of blood vessels. The blood vessel network runs all along the fundal image, varying in density and fineness of structure. Besides, changes in illumination, color and pathology also add to the difficulties in blood vessel segmentation. In this paper, we propose segmentation of blood vessels from fundal images in the deep learning framework, without any pre-processing. A deep convolutional network, consisting of 8 convolutional layers and 3 pooling layers in between, is used to achieve the segmentation. In this work, a Convolutional Neural Network currently in use for semantic image segmentation is customized for blood vessel segmentation by replacing the output layer with a convolutional layer of kernel size 1 × 1 which generates the final segmented image. The output of CNN is a gray scale image and is binarized by thresholding. The proposed method is applied on 2 publicly available databases DRIVE and HRF (capturing diversity in image resolution), consisting of healthy and diseased fundal images boosted by mirror versions of the originals. The method results in an accuracy of 93.94% and yields 0.894 as area under the ROC curve on the test data comprising of randomly selected 23 images from HRF dataset.

Krawiec","Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology, Poland","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","20161103","2016","35","11","2369","2380","The condition of the vascular network of human eye is an important diagnostic factor in ophthalmology. Its segmentation in fundus imaging is a nontrivial task due to variable size of vessels, relatively low contrast, and potential presence of pathologies like microaneurysms and hemorrhages. Many algorithms, both unsupervised and supervised, have been proposed for this purpose in the past. We propose a supervised segmentation technique that uses a deep neural network trained on a large (up to 400 \thinspace000) sample of examples preprocessed with global contrast normalization, zero-phase whitening, and augmented using geometric transformations and gamma corrections. Several variants of the method are considered, including structured prediction, where a network classifies multiple pixels simultaneously. When applied to standard benchmarks of fundus imaging, the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE databases, the networks significantly outperform the previous algorithms on the area under ROC curve measure (up to > 0.99) and accuracy of classification (up to > 0.97). The method is also resistant to the phenomenon of central vessel reflex, sensitive in detection of fine vessels ( sensitivity > 0.87), and fares well on pathological cases.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2546227","10.13039/501100005632 - Narodowe Centrum Bada? i Rozwoju; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440871","Classification;deep learning;feature learning;fundus;neural networks;retina;retinopathy;structured prediction;vessel segmentation","Biomedical imaging;Blood vessels;Convolution;Databases;Image segmentation;Neural networks;Pathology","blood vessels;eye;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets;sensitivity analysis;unsupervised learning","CHASE databases;DRIVE databases;ROC curve;STARE databases;central vessel reflex;deep neural networks;diagnostic factor;fundus imaging;gamma corrections;geometric transformations;global contrast normalization;hemorrhages;human eye;image classification;microaneurysms;nontrivial task;ophthalmology;retinal blood vessel segmentation;structured prediction;supervised segmentation;vascular network;zero-phase whitening","","7","","","","","20160324","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Deep neural ensemble for retinal vessel segmentation in fundus images towards achieving label-free angiography","A. Lahiri; A. G. Roy; D. Sheet; P. K. Biswas","Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India","2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","20161018","2016","","","1340","1343","Automated segmentation of retinal blood vessels in label-free fundus images entails a pivotal role in computed aided diagnosis of ophthalmic pathologies, viz., diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular diseases. The challenge remains active in medical image analysis research due to varied distribution of blood vessels, which manifest variations in their dimensions of physical appearance against a noisy background. In this paper we formulate the segmentation challenge as a classification task. Specifically, we employ unsupervised hierarchical feature learning using ensemble of two level of sparsely trained denoised stacked autoencoder. First level training with bootstrap samples ensures decoupling and second level ensemble formed by different network architectures ensures architectural revision. We show that ensemble training of auto-encoders fosters diversity in learning dictionary of visual kernels for vessel segmentation. SoftMax classifier is used for fine tuning each member autoencoder and multiple strategies are explored for 2-level fusion of ensemble members. On DRIVE dataset, we achieve maximum average accuracy of 95.33% with an impressively low standard deviation of 0.003 and Kappa agreement coefficient of 0.708. Comparison with other major algorithms substantiates the high efficacy of our model.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590955","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590955","","Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Kernel;Retinal vessels;Standards;Training","biomedical optical imaging;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;eye;feature extraction;image classification;image coding;image denoising;image segmentation;medical image processing;unsupervised learning","2-level fusion;DRIVE dataset;Kappa agreement coefficient;SoftMax classifier;architectural revision;autoencoders fosters diversity;automated segmentation;bootstrap samples;cardiovascular diseases;classification task;computed aided diagnosis;deep neural ensemble;diabetic retinopathy;first level training;hypertensive disorders;label-free angiography;label-free fundus images;learning dictionary;maximum average accuracy;medical image analysis;network architectures;noisy background;ophthalmic pathologies;physical appearance;retinal blood vessels;retinal vessel segmentation;sparsely trained denoised stacked autoencoder;standard deviation;unsupervised hierarchical feature learning;visual kernels","","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
