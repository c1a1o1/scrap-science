"Combining Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Skin Detection","H. Zuo; H. Fan; E. Blasch; H.

Besides, age and gender introduce additional difficulties to the detection process. It is hard to determine whether a single pixel is skin or nonskin without considering the context. An efficient traditional hand-engineered skin color detection algorithm requires extensive work by domain experts. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in pixel-wise labeling tasks. However, CNN-based architectures are not sufficient for modeling the relationship between pixels and their neighbors. In this letter, we integrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) layers into the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), and develop an end-to-end network for human skin detection. In particular, FCN layers capture generic local features, while RNN layers model the semantic contextual dependencies in images. Experimental results on the COMPAQ and ECU skin datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where RNN layers enhance the discriminative power of skin detection in complex background situations.","1070-9908;10709908","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2654803","U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820144","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);recurrent neural networks (RNNs);skin classification;skin detection;skin segmentation","Convolution;Detection algorithms;Image color analysis;Lighting;Recurrent neural networks;Skin","image colour analysis;image recognition;recurrent neural nets;skin","COMPAQ skin datasets;ECU skin datasets;FCN layers;complex background situations;convolutional neural networks;deep learning algorithms;dermatology diagnostics;discriminative power;domain experts;end-to-end network;ethnicity geographics;generic local features;hand-engineered skin color detection;human computer interaction;human skin detection;pigment melanin;pixel-wise labeling tasks;preprocessing step;recurrent neural networks;semantic contextual dependency;uneven illumination","","","","","","","20170117","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
