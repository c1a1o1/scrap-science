A nucleosome is a DNA-histone complex, where around 150 base pairs of double-stranded DNA is wrapped. The role of nucleosomes is to pack the DNA into the nucleus of the Eukaryote cells, to form the Chromatin. Nucleosome positioning plays an important role in gene regulation and several studies shows that distinct DNA sequence features have been identified to be associated with nucleosome presence. Starting from this suggestion, the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by DNA sequence features representation and classical supervised classification methods such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic regression and so on.

Although having been successfully applied in such projects as ENCODE and Roadmap to generate landscape of enhancers in human cell lines, high-throughput biological experimental techniques are still costly and time consuming for even larger scale identification of enhancers across a variety of tissues under different disease status, making computational identification of enhancers indispensable. In this paper, we propose a computational framework, named DeepEnhancer, to classify enhancers from background genomic sequences. We construct convolutional neural networks of various architectures and compare the classification performance with traditional sequence-based classifiers. We first train the deep learning model on the FANTOM5 permissive enhancer dataset, and then fine-tune the model on ENCODE cell type-specific enhancer datasets by adopting the transfer learning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepEnhancer has superior efficiency and effectiveness in classification tasks, and the use of max-pooling and batch normalization is beneficial to higher accuracy. To make our approach more understandable, we propose a strategy to visualize the convolutional kernels as sequence logos and compare them against the JASPAR database using TOMTOM. In summary, DeepEnhancer allows researchers to train highly accurate deep models and will be broadly applicable in computational biology.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822593","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822593","","Bioinformatics;Computer architecture;DNA;Feature extraction;Genomics;Kernel;Machine learning","biological tissues;biology computing;diseases;genetics;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","DeepEnhancer;ENCODE cell type-specific enhancer datasets;FANTOM5 permissive enhancer dataset;JASPAR database;Roadmap;TOMTOM;background genomic sequences;batch normalization;classification performance;classification tasks;computational biology;computational framework;computational identification;convolutional kernels;convolutional neural networks;deep learning model;disease status;gene transcriptional regulation;high-throughput biological experimental techniques;human cell lines;max-pooling;sequence logos;tissues;traditional sequence-based classifiers;transfer learning strategy","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes. Extensive experiments using real-world databases, such as METABRIC and NKI, show promising results in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers, for classifying tumors and predicting events like recurrence and metastasis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424407","breast cancer;deep belief networks;microarray data;probabilistic graphical models","Approximation algorithms;Breast cancer;Manifolds;Probabilistic logic;Prognostics and health management;Training","bioinformatics;cancer;genomics;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;tumours","DBN;METABRIC database;NKI database;PGM;SVM classifier;breast cancer diagnosis;breast cancer prognosis;clinical data integration;curse-of-dimensionality;deep-belief networks;genetic disease;genomic variables;high-dimensional microarray data;k-NN classifier;k-nearest neighbors classifier;manifold learning;medical applications;metastasis event prediction;microarray data integration;parameter learning;predictive model;predictive model accuracy improvement;probabilistic graphical model;recurrence event prediction;softmax nodes;structure learning;structure learning algorithm;support vector machine classifier;tumors","","","","20","","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to obtain some more accurate diagnosis results by RBMs, firstly, we transform the SNP data into binary sequences, and then by training the multi-layer RBMs deep network on unlabeled data, the multi-level abstract features of the genomic data are obtained and stored in the network. Finally, by adding a linear classifier to the top of the multi-layer RBMs deep network, the classification results on the testing data are gained. The results show that the average performance of this method is better than that of other methods, e.g., SVM (including linear SVM as well as SVM with multilayer perceptron kernel), sparse representations based classifier and k-nearest neighbors method.

Sequence data from the well studied model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been commonly used to test and validate in silico prediction methods. DNA replication is a critical step in the cellular process and the sequence location where this process originates in the genomic landscape is generally referred as origin of replication. In this paper we investigate the application bidirectional Long Short Term (LSTM) Networks to predict origin of replication sequences. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have recently been shown to yield state of the art performance in speech recognition, and music generation. These networks are capable of learning long term patterns via the use of multiplication gates. This paper utilizes Deep bidirectional LSTM for prediction of origin of replication sequences belonging to the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results demonstrate that LSTMs outperform the commonly used machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personali- ed cancer therapy.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729","National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977954","Multi-platform cancer data analysis;clinical data;genomic data;identification of cancer subtypes;multimodal deep belief network;restricted Boltzmann machine","Bioinformatics;Cancer;Computational biology;DNA;Data analysis;Data models;Genomics","RNA;belief networks;cancer;data analysis;feature extraction;genetics;genomics;medical computing;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;tumours;unsupervised learning","DNA methylation;advancing personalized therapy;cancer data analysis;cancer pathogenesis;cancer patient clustering;cancer subtype identification;complex cross-modality correlations;contrastive divergence;cross-modality correlations;disease pathogenesis;gene expression;high-throughput sequencing technologies;input modality;integrative clustering approaches;integrative data analysis;integrative data analysis approach;intramodality correlations;intrinsic statistical properties;joint latent model;key genes;latent feature extraction;machine learning model;miR-29a;miRNA expression;multimodal DBN based data analysis;multimodal DBN model;multimodal deep belief network;multimodal deep learning approach;multiplatform cancer data;multiplatform genomic data;multiple input modalities;ovarian cancer patients;personalized cancer therapy;practical learning algorithm;tumor samples;unsupervised manner","Computational Biology;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Machine Learning;MicroRNAs;Neoplasms","9","","30","","","20141205","July-Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result, a huge amount of omics data measured from different genetic and epigenetic events are available. For example, the amount of data at The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) alone exceeds 2.5 peta byte as of October 2016. Unfortunately, the dimensions of omics data is huge, typically tens to hundreds or even millions of thousands while the number of samples are limited typically a few to thousands. Thus mining genetic and epigenetic data measured in different phenotype conditions is a very challenging problem, that is, small data sets on extremely high dimensions. Furthermore, all genetic and epigenetic events are inter-related. Thus it is necessary to perform integrated analysis of omics data sets of different types, which is even more challenging. To address these technical challenges, the bioinformatics community has used virtually all known network based analysis techniques, including recently developed deep neural networks. My group has been trying the network based integrated analysis of omics data at three different levels. First, we have been investigating on computational methods for associating different genetic and epigenetic events, which can be viewed as methods for defining edges in the network. Second, we have been developing mining subnetworks on the phenotype and time dimensions. Third, we have recently begun to investigate on the use of deep learning techniques for the integrated analysis of omics data. An important goal of our research is to combine network analysis and deep learning techniques to construct models or draw maps of cancer cells at multiple levels such as genomic mutations, gene activation/suppressions, epigenetic events including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA interference, biological pathways, and finally- at the whole cell level including tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822479","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822479","","","bioinformatics;cancer;genetics;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","DNA methylation;The Cancer Genome Atlas;bioinformatics;biological pathways;cancer cells;clonal evolution;deep learning;deep neural networks;epigenetics events;gene activation;gene suppressions;genetic events;genome wide measurements;genomic mutations;histone modifications;miRNA interference;multi omics data integrated analysis;network based analysis techniques;tumor heterogeneity","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As scientific publishing evolves more and more into electronic formats, the potential of dynamic graphics will change forever the way we visualize and interpret data. Dynamic graphics also affords a valuable teaching tool, for explaining and demonstrating complex concepts such as multivariate relationships and differences between multivariate methods. The presentation concentrates on applications in the life sciences using examples from epidemiology, population disease statistics and genomics.","1330-1012;13301012","POD:978-953-7138-15-8","10.1109/ITI.2009.5196043","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196043","","Animation;Data mining;Data visualization;Diseases;Education;Extraterrestrial phenomena;Graphics;Protocols;Scientific publishing;Statistical learning","computer aided instruction;data mining;data visualisation;statistical analysis;teaching","R language;computer screen;data mining;dynamic graphic;epidemiology;genomics;high-dimensional data;life science;multivariate analysis;population disease statistic;protocol;statistical learning;teaching tool;visualization process","","0","","","","","","22-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, understanding the mechanism through which the transcription factors regulate the gene expression is a challenging task. This is primarily hindered by the low specificity in identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The emergence of the ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) method enables the detection of TFBS at single nucleotide sensitivity, providing us an opportunity to study the detailed mechanisms of TF regulation. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of computational tools that can also provide single base pair (bp) resolution prediction of TFBS. In this paper, we propose DeepSNR, a Deep Learning algorithm for Single Nucleotide Resolution prediction of transcription factor binding site. Our proposed method is inspired by the similarity between predicting the specific binding location from input nucleotide sequence and image segmentation. Particularly, we adopted the deconvolution network (deconvNet); a deep learning model designed for image segmentation, and developed a TFBS specific deconvNet architecture constructed on top of `DeepBind'. We trained a deconvNet for predicting CTCF binding sites using the data from ChIP-exo experiments. The proposed algorithm achieved median precision and recall of 87% and 77% respectively, significantly outperforming motif search based algorithms such as MatInspector.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4179-4; POD:978-1-5090-4180-0","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897204","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;DNA;Deconvolution;Genomics;Machine learning;Training","biological techniques;biology computing;deconvolution;enzymes;genetics;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics","CTCF binding sites;ChIP-exonuclease method;DeepBind;DeepSNR;TFBS specific deconvNet architecture;deconvolution network;deep learning model;gene expression;image segmentation;input nucleotide sequence;single nucleotide resolution;single nucleotide sensitivity;transcription factor binding sites","","","","","","","","16-19 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This greatly enhances the capability to decipher gene structures and explore the diversity of splicing variants. However, existing ab initio aligners are vulnerable to false positive spliced alignments as a result of sequence errors and random sequence matches. These spurious alignments can lead to a significant set of false positive splice junction predictions, confusing downstream analyses of splice variant detection and abundance estimation. In this work, we illustrate that splice junction sequence characteristics can be ascertained from experimental data with deep learning techniques.

Previous works have established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images. However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding. It enables a new type of QA with visual answers, in addition to textual answers used in previous work.

The application of deep-learning to problems in healthcare, however, has gained attention only in recent years, and it's ultimate place at the bedside remains a topic of skeptical discussion. While there is a growing academic interest in the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to clinical problems, many in the clinical community see little incentive to upgrade from simpler methods, such as logistic regression, to deep learning. Logistic regression, after all, provides odds ratios, p-values and confidence intervals that allow for ease of interpretation, while deep nets are often seen as `black-boxes' which are difficult to understand and, as of yet, have not demonstrated performance levels far exceeding their simpler counterparts. If deep learning is to ever take a place at the bedside, it will require studies which (1) showcase the performance of deep-learning methods relative to other approaches and (2) interpret the relationships between network structure, model performance, features and outcomes. We have chosen these two requirements as the goal of this study. In our investigation, we utilized a publicly available EMR dataset of over 32,000 intensive care unit patients and trained a Deep Belief Network (DBN) to predict patient mortality at discharge.

These sequences are usually named candidates to miRNA. The well-known pre-miRNAs are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates to miRNA that have to be analyzed, which makes this task a high classimbalance classification problem. The classical way of approaching it has been training a binary classifier in a supervised manner, using well-known pre-miRNAs as positive class and artificially defining the negative class. However, although the selection of positive labeled examples is straightforward, it is very difficult to build a set of negative examples in order to obtain a good set of training samples for a supervised method. In this work, we propose a novel and effective way of approaching this problem using machine learning, without the definition of negative examples. The proposal is based on clustering unlabeled sequences of a genome together with well-known miRNA precursors for the organism under study, which allows for the quick identification of the best candidates to miRNA as those sequences clustered with known precursors. Furthermore, we propose a deep model to overcome the problem of having very few positive class labels. They are always maintained in the deep levels as positive class while less likely pre-miRNA sequences are filtered level after level. Our approach has been compared with other methods for pre-miRNAs prediction in several species, showing effective predictivity of novel miRNAs. Additionally, we will show that our approach has a lower training time and allows for a better graphical navegability and interpretation of the results.

However, due to the nonlinear and imbalanced nature of biological data, many machine learning approaches have their own limitations. Recently, deep learning techniques show advantages over many state-of-the-art machine learning methods in many applications.

Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2015.2461219","Department of Energy; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219432","Comparative metagenomics;metagenomics;microbiome;neural networks","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Nanobioscience;Neural networks;Organisms;Training;Vegetation","DNA;genomics;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;molecular biophysics;multilayer perceptrons;natural language processing;neurophysiology","classification accuracy;data structure;deep belief network;deep learning methods;generalization performance;hierarchical representations;image classification;language modeling;machine learning;machine learning community;metagenomic classification;metagenomic data analysis;metagenomic literature;multilayer perceptron;multilayer-recursive neural networks;natural language processing;neural networks;nonlinear feature representations;prediction algorithm;predictive metagenomic analysis;unsupervised fashion","Algorithms;Metagenomics;Microbiota;Neural Networks (Computer)","4","","44","","","20150824","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes. Experimental results show that the approach was able to outperform classical feature selection methods in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 9%, lung cancer by 6% and breast cancer by around 10% in F1-measure.

These results indicated the isomiRs maybe not just the inexact Dicer processing, but were the product of pre-miRNAs with some unknown but special bio-rules, which could give some impressing suspects for researches to better understand this novel phenomena ofisomiRs.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0077-4; POD:978-1-4577-0076-7","10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107686","","Bioinformatics;Educational institutions;Genomics;Laboratories;Pregnancy;RNA;Solids","RNA;biological techniques;molecular biophysics","Dicer processing;deep sequencing data;high throughput sequencing technology;miRNA expression profile;microRNA isoform expression analysis;nucleic acids;oligonucleotide addition;oligonucleotide subtraction;placenta","","0","","11","","","","3-5 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Ontology-Based Protein-Protein Interactions Extraction from Literature Using the Hidden Vector State Model","Y. He; K. Nakata; D. Zhou","Sch. of Eng., Comput. & Math., Univ. of Exeter, Exeter","2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","20081230","2008","","","736","743","This paper proposes a novel framework of incorporating protein-protein interactions (PPI) ontology knowledge into PPI extraction from biomedical literature in order to address the emerging challenges of deep natural language understanding. It is built upon the existing work on relation extraction using the hidden vector state (HVS) model. The HVS model belongs to the category of statistical learning methods. It can be trained directly from un-annotated data in a constrained way whilst at the same time being able to capture the underlying named entity relationships. However, it is difficult to incorporate background knowledge or non-local information into the HVS model. This paper proposes to represent the HVS model as a conditionally trained undirected graphical model in which non-local features derived from PPI ontology through inference would be easily incorporated. The seamless fusion of ontology inference with statistical learning produces a new paradigm to information extraction.","2375-9232;23759232","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3503-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2008.11","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734001","Hidden Vector State model;PPI ontology;Protein-protein interactions extraction;information extraction","Bioinformatics;Biomedical computing;Conferences;Data mining;Genomics;Mathematical model;Natural languages;Ontologies;Protein engineering;Statistical learning","medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);proteins;statistical analysis","PPI extraction;biomedical literature;deep natural language understanding;hidden vector state model;ontology inference;ontology-based protein-protein interactions extraction;protein-protein interactions ontology knowledge;statistical learning methods","","0","","33","","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
