The second process allows to identify the situation of proximity to the obstacles (from the information of a laser sensor) to decide the direction and speed of the robot to navigate in an interior space.

In this paper, we use deep architectures pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using denoising autoencoders as a preprocessing step for a popular unsupervised learning task. Denoising autoencoders (DA) can be used to learn a compact representation of input, and have been used to generate features for further supervised learning tasks.

A nucleosome is a DNA-histone complex, where around 150 base pairs of double-stranded DNA is wrapped. The role of nucleosomes is to pack the DNA into the nucleus of the Eukaryote cells, to form the Chromatin. Nucleosome positioning plays an important role in gene regulation and several studies shows that distinct DNA sequence features have been identified to be associated with nucleosome presence. Starting from this suggestion, the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by DNA sequence features representation and classical supervised classification methods such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic regression and so on.

However, understanding the mechanism through which the transcription factors regulate the gene expression is a challenging task. This is primarily hindered by the low specificity in identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The emergence of the ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) method enables the detection of TFBS at single nucleotide sensitivity, providing us an opportunity to study the detailed mechanisms of TF regulation. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of computational tools that can also provide single base pair (bp) resolution prediction of TFBS. In this paper, we propose DeepSNR, a Deep Learning algorithm for Single Nucleotide Resolution prediction of transcription factor binding site. Our proposed method is inspired by the similarity between predicting the specific binding location from input nucleotide sequence and image segmentation. Particularly, we adopted the deconvolution network (deconvNet); a deep learning model designed for image segmentation, and developed a TFBS specific deconvNet architecture constructed on top of `DeepBind'. We trained a deconvNet for predicting CTCF binding sites using the data from ChIP-exo experiments. The proposed algorithm achieved median precision and recall of 87% and 77% respectively, significantly outperforming motif search based algorithms such as MatInspector.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4179-4; POD:978-1-5090-4180-0","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897204","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;DNA;Deconvolution;Genomics;Machine learning;Training","biological techniques;biology computing;deconvolution;enzymes;genetics;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics","CTCF binding sites;ChIP-exonuclease method;DeepBind;DeepSNR;TFBS specific deconvNet architecture;deconvolution network;deep learning model;gene expression;image segmentation;input nucleotide sequence;single nucleotide resolution;single nucleotide sensitivity;transcription factor binding sites","","","","","","","","16-19 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a computational framework, named DeepEnhancer, to classify enhancers from background genomic sequences. We construct convolutional neural networks of various architectures and compare the classification performance with traditional sequence-based classifiers. We first train the deep learning model on the FANTOM5 permissive enhancer dataset, and then fine-tune the model on ENCODE cell type-specific enhancer datasets by adopting the transfer learning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepEnhancer has superior efficiency and effectiveness in classification tasks, and the use of max-pooling and batch normalization is beneficial to higher accuracy. To make our approach more understandable, we propose a strategy to visualize the convolutional kernels as sequence logos and compare them against the JASPAR database using TOMTOM.

Gene expression profiling is being widely used in cancer studies to discover informative biomarkers that aid predict different clinical endpoint prediction. We use multiple modalities of data derived from RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) to predict survival of cancer patients. Despite the wealth of information available in expression profiles of cancer tumors, fulfilling the aforementioned objective remains a big challenge, for the most part, due to the paucity of data samples compared to the high dimension of the expression profiles. As such, analysis of transcriptomic data modalities calls for state-of-the-art big-data analytics techniques that can maximally use all the available data to discover the relevant information hidden within a significant amount of noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that predicts cancer patients' survival by exploiting the structure of the input (manifold learning) and by leveraging the unlabeled samples using Laplacian support vector machines, a graph-based semi supervised learning (GSSL) paradigm. We show that under certain circumstances, no single modality per se will result in the best accuracy and by fusing different models together via a stacked generalization strategy, we may boost the accuracy synergistically. We apply our approach to two cancer datasets and present promising results.

While SSAE learns high-level features from data, performing feature selection in every layer is a heuristic to obtain relevant features at every stage and also to assist in reducing the computation during fine-tuning procedure. The data in the new feature representation is finally used by classifier(s) to perform Tumor detection. The algorithm was tested on 36 datasets from the GEMLeR repository and w.r.t.

Such image representation is however not suitable for controlled vocabulary term annotation. Here, we developed feature extraction methods to generate hierarchical representations for ISH images. Our approach is based on the deep convolutional neural networks that can act on image pixels directly. To make the extracted features generic, the models were trained using a natural image set with millions of labeled examples. These models were transferred to the ISH image domain. To account for the differences between the source and target domains, we proposed a partial transfer learning scheme in which only part of the source model is transferred. We employed multi-task learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained models with labeled ISH images. Results showed that feature representations computed by deep models based on transfer and multi-task learning significantly outperformed other methods for annotating gene expression patterns at different stage ranges.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2573280","10.13039/100000002 - National Institutes of Health; 10.13039/100000145 - Division of Information and Intelligent Systems; 10.13039/100000153 - Division of Biological Infrastructure; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480825","Deep learning;bioinformatics;image analysis;multi-task learning;transfer learning","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Gene expression;Training","","","","","","","","","20160530","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thereby making researchers elude epitome of representations. Hence learning algorithms never reach their full potential. In recent times there has been a shift from hand-crafting features to representation learning. The resulting features are not only optimal but also generic as in they can be used as off the shelf features for visual recognition tasks. In this paper we design and experiment with a basic deep convolution neural nets for learning generic vision features with an variant of convolving kernels. They operate by giving importance to individual uncorrelated color channels in a color model by convolving each channel with channel specific kernels.

In these settings, the relations between instances and labels are usually ambiguous. In contrast, multi-task learning focuses on the output space in which an input sample is associated with multiple labels. In real world, a sample may be associated with multiple labels that are derived from observing multiple aspects of the problem. Thus many real world applications are naturally formulated as multi-instance multi-task (MIMT) problems. A common approach to MIMT is to solve it task-by-task independently under the multi-instance learning framework. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance in single-instance single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN deals with multi-instance multi-label tasks still remains an open problem. This is mainly due to the complex multiple-to-multiple relations between the input and output space. In this work, we propose a deep leaning model, known as multi-instance multi-task convolutional neural networks (MIMT-CNN), where a number of images representing a multi-task problem is taken as the inputs. Then a shared sub-CNN is connected with each input image to form instance representations. Those sub-CNN outputs are subsequently aggregated as inputs to additional convolutional layers and full connection layers to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. This CNN model, through transfer learning from other domains, enables transfer of prior knowledge at image level learned from large single-label single-task data sets. The bag level representations in this model are hierarchically abstracted by multiple layers from instance level representations. Experimental results on mouse brain gene expression pattern annotation data show that the proposed MIMT-CNN model achieves superior performance.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4673-9504-5; POD:978-1-4673-9505-2","10.1109/ICDM.2015.92","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373362","Deep learning;bioinformatics;multi-instance learning;multi-task learning;transfer learning","Biological system modeling;Brain models;Data models;Gene expression;Standards","image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","MIMT-CNN problem;bag level representations;complex multiple-to-multiple relations;deep convolutional neural networks;deep leaning model;image representation;mouse brain gene expression pattern annotation data;multiinstance multilabel tasks;multiinstance multitask convolutional neural networks;multiinstance multitask learning;single-instance single-label image classification tasks;single-label single-task data sets;transfer learning;ultimate multilabel predictions","","1","","30","","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personali- ed cancer therapy.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729","National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977954","Multi-platform cancer data analysis;clinical data;genomic data;identification of cancer subtypes;multimodal deep belief network;restricted Boltzmann machine","Bioinformatics;Cancer;Computational biology;DNA;Data analysis;Data models;Genomics","RNA;belief networks;cancer;data analysis;feature extraction;genetics;genomics;medical computing;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;tumours;unsupervised learning","DNA methylation;advancing personalized therapy;cancer data analysis;cancer pathogenesis;cancer patient clustering;cancer subtype identification;complex cross-modality correlations;contrastive divergence;cross-modality correlations;disease pathogenesis;gene expression;high-throughput sequencing technologies;input modality;integrative clustering approaches;integrative data analysis;integrative data analysis approach;intramodality correlations;intrinsic statistical properties;joint latent model;key genes;latent feature extraction;machine learning model;miR-29a;miRNA expression;multimodal DBN based data analysis;multimodal DBN model;multimodal deep belief network;multimodal deep learning approach;multiplatform cancer data;multiplatform genomic data;multiple input modalities;ovarian cancer patients;personalized cancer therapy;practical learning algorithm;tumor samples;unsupervised manner","Computational Biology;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Machine Learning;MicroRNAs;Neoplasms","9","","30","","","20141205","July-Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes. Experimental results show that the approach was able to outperform classical feature selection methods in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 9%, lung cancer by 6% and breast cancer by around 10% in F1-measure.

While various biclustering algorithms (e.g., combinatorial, probabilistic modelling, and matrix factorization) have been proposed and constantly improved in the past decade, data noise and bicluster overlaps make biclustering a still challenging task. It becomes difficult to further improve biclustering performance, without resorting to a new approach. Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning using deep neural networks, in this work, we propose a novel model for biclustering, named Auto Decoder (AD), by relating biclusters to features and leveraging a neural network that is able to automatically learn features from the input data. To suppress severe noise present in gene expression data, we introduce a non-uniform signal recovery mechanism: Instead of reconstructing the whole input data to capture the bicluster patterns, AD weighs the zero and non-zero parts of the input data differently and is more flexible in dealing with different types of noise. AD is also properly regularized to deal with bicluster overlaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first biclustering algorithm that leverages neural network techniques to recover overlapped biclusters hidden in noisy gene expression data. We compared our approach with four state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. On three out of the four real datasets, AD significantly outperforms the other approaches. On controlled synthetic datasets, AD performs the best when noise level is beyond 15%.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-5108-1; POD:978-1-4799-1328-2","10.1109/ICDM.2013.34","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729555","Biclustering;Gene Expression;Neural Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Gene expression;Neural networks;Neurons;Noise;Noise level;Robustness","biology computing;genetics;neural nets;pattern clustering;pattern recognition;unsupervised learning","AD;AutoDecoder;automatic feature learning;bicluster patterns;biclustering algorithms;co-expressed genes;deep neural networks;noise suppression;noise-resistant bicluster recognition;noisy gene expression data;nonuniform signal recovery mechanism;overlapped bicluster recovery;real datasets;synthetic datasets;unsupervised feature learning","","0","","45","","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the annealing robust fuzzy basis function (ARFBF) is proposed to improve the problems of fuzzy basis function for modeling of gene expression of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems with outliers. Firstly, the support vector regression (SVR) approach is proposed to determine the initial structure of ARFBF. Because of a SVR approach is equivalent to solving a linear constrained quadratic programming problem under a fixed structure of SVR, the number of hidden nodes, the initial parameters and the initial weights of ARFBF are easy obtained via the SVR approach. Secondly, the results of SVR are used as initial structure in ARFBF. At the same time, an annealing robust learning algorithm (ARLA) is used as the learning algorithm for ARFBF, and applied to adjust the parameters as well as weights of ARFBF. That is, an ARLA is proposed to overcome the problems of initialization and the cut-off points in the robust learning algorithm. Hence, when an initial structure of ARFBF is determined by a SVR approach, the ARFBF with ARLA have fast convergence speed and robust against outliers for the modeling of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems.","1098-7584;10987584","CD-ROM:1-4244-1210-2; POD:1-4244-1209-9","10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295376","","Annealing;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;DNA;Feedback loop;Fuzzy systems;Gene expression;Robustness;Sequences","DNA;biology computing;constraint handling;feedback;fuzzy neural nets;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;molecular biophysics;proteins;quadratic programming;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","DNA sequences;RNA synthesis;SVR approach;annealing robust fuzzy basis function;annealing robust learning algorithm;bioinformatics;gene expression modeling;lift sciences;linear constrained quadratic programming problem;molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems;protein generation;support vector regression","","3","","21","","","","23-26 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, a huge amount of omics data measured from different genetic and epigenetic events are available. For example, the amount of data at The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) alone exceeds 2.5 peta byte as of October 2016. Unfortunately, the dimensions of omics data is huge, typically tens to hundreds or even millions of thousands while the number of samples are limited typically a few to thousands. Thus mining genetic and epigenetic data measured in different phenotype conditions is a very challenging problem, that is, small data sets on extremely high dimensions. Furthermore, all genetic and epigenetic events are inter-related. Thus it is necessary to perform integrated analysis of omics data sets of different types, which is even more challenging. To address these technical challenges, the bioinformatics community has used virtually all known network based analysis techniques, including recently developed deep neural networks. My group has been trying the network based integrated analysis of omics data at three different levels. First, we have been investigating on computational methods for associating different genetic and epigenetic events, which can be viewed as methods for defining edges in the network. Second, we have been developing mining subnetworks on the phenotype and time dimensions. Third, we have recently begun to investigate on the use of deep learning techniques for the integrated analysis of omics data. An important goal of our research is to combine network analysis and deep learning techniques to construct models or draw maps of cancer cells at multiple levels such as genomic mutations, gene activation/suppressions, epigenetic events including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA interference, biological pathways, and finally- at the whole cell level including tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822479","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822479","","","bioinformatics;cancer;genetics;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","DNA methylation;The Cancer Genome Atlas;bioinformatics;biological pathways;cancer cells;clonal evolution;deep learning;deep neural networks;epigenetics events;gene activation;gene suppressions;genetic events;genome wide measurements;genomic mutations;histone modifications;miRNA interference;multi omics data integrated analysis;network based analysis techniques;tumor heterogeneity","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better understand miRNAs, the miRNA regulatory mechanism needs to be investigated and the real targets identified. Here, we present miRTDL, a new miRNA target prediction algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN automatically extracts essential information from the input data rather than completely relying on the input dataset generated artificially when the precise miRNA target mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, the constraint relaxing method is first used to construct a balanced training dataset to avoid inaccurate predictions caused by the existing unbalanced dataset. The miRTDL is then applied to 1,606 experimentally validated miRNA target pairs. Finally, the results show that our miRTDL outperforms the existing target prediction algorithms and achieves significantly higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 88.43, 96.44, and 89.98 percent, respectively. We also investigate the miRNA target mechanism, and the results show that the complementation features are more important than the others.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2015.2510002","Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362158","Constraint relaxation;convolutional neural network;miRNA;target prediction","Diseases;Machine learning;Matched filters;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;RNA;Support vector machines","RNA;bioinformatics;biological techniques;diseases;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;neural nets","CNN;MiRTDL;balanced training dataset;convolutional neural network;deep learning approach;diseases;essential information;genes;miRNA regulatory mechanism;miRNA target pairs;miRNA target prediction algorithm;miRTDL;microRNA;real targets","","1","","","","","20151222","November 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A three-layer deep belief network (DBN) with two hidden layers and one visible layer was employed to generate a model for classification, and the model's robustness against exacerbation was analyzed. Subjects from the COPDGene cohort were staged using the GOLD 2011 guidelines. 10,300 subjects with 361 features each were included in the analysis. After feature selection and parameter optimization, the proposed classification method achieved an accuracy of 97.2% by using a 10-fold cross validation experiment. The most sensitive features as revealed by the DBN weights were consistent with the clinical consensus as per previous studies and clinical diagnosis rules. In summary, we demonstrate that the DBN is a competitive tool for exacerbation risk assessment for patients suffering from, COPD.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9988-0; POD:978-1-4799-9989-7; USB:978-1-4799-9987-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472122","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7472122","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD);Deep Belief Networks (DBNs);Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD);classification;deep learning","Diseases;Feature extraction;Gold;Lungs;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training","belief networks;biology computing;diseases;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","COPD gene cohort;DBN weights;automatic gold classification;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;deep learning;exacerbation risk assessment;feature selection;parameter optimization;three-layer deep belief network","","","","19","","","","20-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A cancer disease in any of its forms represents a major cause of death worldwide. In cancer diagnosis, classification of different tumor types is of the greatest significance. Accuracy for prediction of various tumor types gives better treatment and minimization of toxicity on patients. Accordingly, creating methodologies that can effectively differentiate between cancer subtypes is essential. This paper presents a new methodology to classify Human cancer diseases based on the gene expression profiles. The proposed methodology combines both Information gain (IG) and Deep Genetic Algorithm (DGA). It first uses IG for feature selection, then uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature reduction and finally uses Genetic Programming (GP) for cancer types' classification. The proposed system is evaluated by classifying cancer diseases in seven cancer datasets and the results are compared with most recent approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0275-7; POD:978-1-5090-0276-4","10.1109/ICENCO.2015.7416345","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7416345","Cancer Diagnosis/Classification;Decision Support System;Feature Selection;Gene Expression;Genetic Algorithm;Information Gain;Machine Learning","Cancer;Colon;Diseases;Lungs;Morphology;Tumors","cancer;cellular biophysics;feature selection;genetic algorithms;genetics;medical computing;patient treatment;pattern classification","DGA;abnormal cell growth;cancer diagnosis;cancer types classification;deep genetic algorithm;feature reduction;feature selection;gene expression profiles;genetic programming;human cancer diseases classification;information gain;patient treatment;toxicity minimization;tumor type classification","","","","43","","","","29-30 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A non-problem related feature contains little information and has little influence on the data distribution. By permuting the feature and calculating the data distribution difference, how much information the feature contains could be measured. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method (EUFSPR), which combines the ensemble technique, clustering, permutation and data distribution evaluation techniques to measure the feature importance. Clustering is adopted to get the sample groups and the data distribution is evaluated by the overlapping areas. Eight gene expression microarray datasets are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the unsupervised feature selection methods and supervised feature selection methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7681-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7682-2; POD:978-1-4673-7683-9","10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382044","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7382044","clustering;ensemble technique;permutation;unsupervised feature selection","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Indexes;Support vector machines;Unsupervised learning","bioinformatics;feature selection;pattern classification;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","EUFSPR;R-value;data classification;data distribution;data distribution evaluation techniques;ensemble unsupervised feature selection method;feature importance measure;gene expression microarray datasets;high-dimensional data;nonproblem related feature;pattern clustering;performance improvement;permutation method;supervised feature selection methods","","","","34","","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new approach to designing neural networks is presented. The structure of the proposed NN is not strictly defined (each neuron may receive input from any other neuron). Instead, the initial network structure can be randomly generated, and traditional methods of training, such as back-propagation, are replaced or augmented by a genetic algorithm (GA). The weighting of each neuron input is encoded genetically to serve as the genes for the GA. By means of the training data provided to the supervised network, the contribution of each neuron in creating a desired output serves as a selection function. Each of the neurons is then modified to store and recall past weightings for possible future use. A simple network is trained to recognize vertical and horizontal lines as a proof of concept.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8069-7; POD:978-1-4799-8070-3; USB:978-1-4673-6900-8","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116001","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116001","Neural network;biologically inspired;complex neuron;deep learning;genetic algorithm;weight retention","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Genetic algorithms;Neurons;Training","backpropagation;genetic algorithms;neural nets","ANN;GA-based learning method;artificial neural networks;backpropagation;dynamic structure;genetic algorithm;selection function;supervised network","","2","","7","","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Predicting age at loss of ambulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy with deep phenotypic measures","Y. Wang; L. Bello; Y. Wang; C. M. McDonald; E. P. Hoffman; G.

The loss of ambulation (LoA) is a functional milestone of DMD progression and the age at LoA is often used as an indication of disease severity. But as age at LoA is not always available, such as when patients remain ambulant at study end, its use has been limited. In this paper, we report machine learning approaches to predict age at LoA based on clinical measures of muscular strength and motor function, and validate the algorithms using the CINRG dataset. With extensive experiments and rigorous statistical analysis, we found that (1) the utilization of multiple clinical features yields better prediction than using any of the single measures, and (2) the prediction based on Lasso is more accurate than other multivariate analytical approaches such as ordinary least squares and ridge regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide point predictions for age at LoA in DMD using clinical phenotypic measures. Importantly, we find that not all clinical measures contribute to the prediction. Age at the last visit (before LoA), velocity of walking 10 meters, and velocity of climbing 4 steps are selected as important predictors by Lasso. The usefulness of the prediction model is illustrated with evidence that the association between a well-known modifier of DMD severity and age at LoA has better power when the predicted values are utilized.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7088-9; POD:978-1-4799-7089-6; USB:978-1-4799-7087-2","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032343","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032343","","Accuracy;Data models;Diseases;Drugs;Loss measurement;Numerical models;Predictive models","diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders;muscle;statistical analysis","DMD;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;LoA;age prediction;clinical phenotypic measure;loss of ambulation;machine learning;single-gene lethal disorder;statistical analysis","","0","","8","","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this study is the development of a vision system for coral detections based on supervised machine learning. In order to achieve this, we use a bank of Gabor Wavelet filters to extract texture feature descriptors, we use learning classifiers, from OpenCV library, to discriminate coral from non-coral reef. We compare: running time, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of nine different learning classifiers. We select Decision Trees algorithm because it shows the fastest and the most accurate performance. For the evaluation of this system, we use a database of 621 images (developed for this purpose), that represents the coral reef located in Belize: 110 for training the classifiers and 511 for testing the coral detector.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5948-8; POD:978-1-4799-5949-5","10.1109/SSCO.2014.7000371","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000371","","Accuracy;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Vectors","Gabor filters;autonomous underwater vehicles;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques","AUV;Belize;Gabor wavelet feature descriptor;Gabor wavelet filter;OpenCV library;autonomous underwater vehicle;coral detector testing;decision tree algorithm;deep sea;fast coral detector implementation;image database;learning classifier;learning classifier accuracy;learning classifier running time;learning classifier sensitivity;learning classifier specificity;noncoral reef discrimination;reef area location detection;reef restoration task;supervised machine learning;system evaluation;texture feature descriptor extraction;vision system development;volunteer SCUBA diver","","3","","18","","","","13-17 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
