"Integrating Online and Offline Three-Dimensional Deep Learning for Automated Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Videos","L. Yu; H. Chen; Q. Dou; J. Qin; P. A. Heng","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","20170520","2017","21","1","65","75","Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos has been demonstrated to be a promising way for colorectal cancer prevention and diagnosis. Traditional manual screening is time consuming, operator dependent, and error prone; hence, automated detection approach is highly demanded in clinical practice. However, automated polyp detection is very challenging due to high intraclass variations in polyp size, color, shape, and texture, and low interclass variations between polyps and hard mimics. In this paper, we propose a novel offline and online three-dimensional (3-D) deep learning integration framework by leveraging the 3-D fully convolutional network (3D-FCN) to tackle this challenging problem. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or 2-D convolutional neural network, the 3D-FCN is capable of learning more representative spatio-temporal features from colonoscopy videos, and hence has more powerful discrimination capability. More importantly, we propose a novel online learning scheme to deal with the problem of limited training data by harnessing the specific information of an input video in the learning process. We integrate offline and online learning to effectively reduce the number of false positives generated by the offline network and further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on the dataset of MICCAI 2015 Challenge on Polyp Detection demonstrated the better performance of our method when compared with other competitors.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2637004","Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776845","Automated polyp detection;colonoscopy video;computer-aided diagnosis;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning","Cancer;Colonoscopy;Feature extraction;MIMICs;Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Videos","cancer;endoscopes;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;video signal processing","3D fully convolutional network;automated polyp detection;colonoscopy videos;colorectal cancer diagnosis;colorectal cancer prevention;offline three-dimensional deep learning integration framework;online three-dimensional deep learning integration framework;spatiotemporal features","","","","","","","20161207","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Automatic Detection and Classification of Colorectal Polyps by Transferring Low-Level CNN Features From Nonmedical Domain","R. Zhang; Y. Zheng; T. W. C. Mak; R. Yu; S. H. Wong; J. Y. W. Lau; C. C.

Poon","Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","20170520","2017","21","1","41","47","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although polypectomy at early stage reduces CRC incidence, 90% of the polyps are small and diminutive, where removal of them poses risks to patients that may outweigh the benefits. Correctly detecting and predicting polyp type during colonoscopy allows endoscopists to resect and discard the tissue without submitting it for histology, saving time, and costs. Nevertheless, human visual observation of early stage polyps varies. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a fully automatic algorithm to detect and classify hyperplastic and adenomatous colorectal polyps. Adenomatous polyps should be removed, whereas distal diminutive hyperplastic polyps are considered clinically insignificant and may be left in situ . A novel transfer learning application is proposed utilizing features learned from big nonmedical datasets with 1.4-2.5 million images using deep convolutional neural network. The endoscopic images we collected for experiment were taken under random lighting conditions, zooming and optical magnification, including 1104 endoscopic nonpolyp images taken under both white-light and narrowband imaging (NBI) endoscopy and 826 NBI endoscopic polyp images, of which 263 images were hyperplasia and 563 were adenoma as confirmed by histology. The proposed method identified polyp images from nonpolyp images in the beginning followed by predicting the polyp histology. When compared with visual inspection by endoscopists, the results of this study show that the proposed method has similar precision (87.3% versus 86.4%) but a higher recall rate (87.6% versus 77.0%) and a higher accuracy (85.9% versus 74.3%). In conclusion, automatic algorithms can assist endoscopists in identifying polyps that are adenomatous but have been incorrectly judged as hyperplasia and, therefore, enable timely resection of these polyps at an early stage before they develop into invasive cancer.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635662","Chow Yuk Ho Technology Centre for Innovative Medicine; Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund, Shaw Endoscopy Center; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7769237","Colorectal cancer;deep learning;health informatics;polyp diagnosis","Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Colonoscopy;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neurons;Training","biological tissues;biomedical optical imaging;cancer;endoscopes","NBI endoscopic polyp images;adenomatous colorectal polyps;cancer deaths;colonoscopy;colorectal cancer;colorectal polyps automatic detection;colorectal polyps classification;deep convolutional neural network;endoscopic images;endoscopic nonpolyp images;fully automatic algorithm;human visual observation;hyperplasia;hyperplastic colorectal polyps;learning application;low-level CNN features;narrowband imaging endoscopy;nonmedical datasets;optical magnification;polyp histology;polypectomy;tissue;white-light endoscopy","","","","","","","20161205","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Comparison of hand-craft feature based SVM and CNN based deep learning framework for automatic polyp classification","Y. Shin; I.

Miss-detected polyps in colonoscopy are potential risk factor for colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigate an automatic polyp classification framework. We aim to compare two different approaches named hand-craft feature method and convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning method. Combined shape and color features are used for hand craft feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) method is adopted for classification. For CNN approach, three convolution and pooling based deep learning framework is used for classification purpose. The proposed framework is evaluated using three public polyp databases. From the experimental results, we have shown that the CNN based deep learning framework shows better classification performance than the hand-craft feature based methods. It achieves over 90% of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2809-2; POD:978-1-5090-2810-8","10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037556","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8037556","","","","","","","","","","","","11-15 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
