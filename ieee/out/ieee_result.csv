MRCNN employs Gabor-local binary pattern (Gabor-LBP) which introduces a good property in image analysis - invariance to image scales and rotations. In addition, we offer an approach to deal with the problems caused by imbalanced number of samples between different classes in most of the existing works, accomplished by changing the overlapping size between the adjacent patches.

Ning",2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017). 2017,Adrenal lesions detection on low-contrast CT images using fully convolutional networks with multi-scale integration,"Adrenal lesions include a wide variety of benign and malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland, and are seen in up to 5% of computed tomography (CT) examinations of the abdomen. Better identification of these lesions is important for effective management and patient prognosis. Detection on low-contrast CT images, however, even for experienced physicians can be difficult and error-prone, because the lesions are often problematic to be separated from the normal surrounding structures. Existing lesion detection techniques have problems in identifying and differentiating low-contrast tumors, which is related to their use of low-level features rather than high level of semantics. Hence we propose an automated approach using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and multi-scale integration to detect adrenal lesion on low-contrast CT scans. The architecture of FCNs includes deep, coarse, semantic information and shallow, fine, appearance information in a hierarchical manner and it enables the encoding of image-wide location and semantics, which are desirable characteristics for adrenal lesion detection. We also propose a multi-scale integration with a superpixel based random walk (MI-SRW) approach to refine the lesion boundaries on different scales. The MI-SRW technique enables us to constrain the spatial and appearance consistency and then use complementary information provided on different scales to detect adrenal lesions of various sizes and characteristics. We used 38 adrenal lesions detected on low-contrast CT and compared our approach to existing `state-of-the-art' methods and found that our approach had superior detection performance.",10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950660,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950660,460c590e-50ee-42e0-86bd-ff4ae88abbb9,ieee,1,2017

The spatial complexity and variability of anatomy throughout the human body makes classification difficult. “Deep learning” methods such as convolutional networks (ConvNets) outperform other state-of-the-art methods in image classification tasks. In this work, we present a method for organ- or body-part-specific anatomical classification of medical images acquired using computed tomography (CT) with ConvNets. We train a ConvNet, using 4,298 separate axial 2D key-images to learn 5 anatomical classes. Key-images were mined from a hospital PACS archive, using a set of 1,675 patients. We show that a data augmentation approach can help to enrich the data set and improve classification performance. Using ConvNets and data augmentation, we achieve anatomy-specific classification error of 5.9 % and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of an average of 0.998 in testing.

Unser",IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. 2017,Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Inverse Problems in Imaging,"In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of hyperparameter selection. The starting point of this paper is the observation that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by pointwise nonlinearity) when the normal operator (H*H, where H* is the adjoint of the forward imaging operator, H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms. The proposed network outperforms total variation-regularized iterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms and requires less than a second to reconstruct a 512 × 512 image on the GPU.",10.1109/TIP.2017.2713099,[u'holger.roth@nih.govorrms'],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7949028,f5ef134f-bd46-49bf-a5bc-d0d95325c0b0,ieee,1,2017

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.",10.1109/TMI.2016.2535302,"[u'tajbakhsh@asu.edu', u'sejong@asu.edu', u'gurudu.suryakanth@mayo.edu', u'hurst.r@mayo.edu', u'christopher@mayo.edu', u'gotway.michael@mayo.edu', u'jianming.liang@asu.edu']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426826,1dca0532-e410-4f5f-b0a7-98e7f45c4ff9,ieee,1,2016

Denzinger",2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). 2016,Lung nodule detection in CT images using deep convolutional neural networks,"Early detection of lung nodules in thoracic Computed Tomography (CT) scans is of great importance for the successful diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Due to improvements in screening technologies, and an increased demand for their use, radiologists are required to analyze an ever increasing amount of image data, which can affect the quality of their diagnoses. Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) systems are designed to assist radiologists in this endeavor. Here, we present a CADe system for the detection of lung nodules in thoracic CT images. Our system is based on (1) the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI) database, which contains 1018 thoracic CT scans with nodules of different shape and size, and (2) a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained, using the back-propagation algorithm, to extract valuable volumetric features from the input data and detect lung nodules in sub-volumes of CT images. Considering only those test nodules that have been annotated by four radiologists, our CADe system achieves a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 78.9% with 20 false positives (FPs) per scan, or a sensitivity of 71.2% with 10 FPs per scan. This is achieved without using any segmentation or additional FP reduction procedures, both of which are commonly used in other CADe systems. Furthermore, our CADe system is validated on a larger number of lung nodules compared to other studies, which increases the variation in their appearance, and therefore, makes their detection by a CADe system more challenging.",10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727205,"[u'grotem@ucalgary.ca', u'cjacob@ucalgary.ca', u'denzinge@cpsc.ucalgary.ca']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727205,94ba9ab3-dab6-400f-995d-7fdd12a1fde8,ieee,1,2016

Currently, the main stream low-dose CT methods include vendor-specific sinogram domain filtration and iterative reconstruction algorithms, but they need to access raw data whose formats are not transparent to most users. Due to the difficulty of modeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing methods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image noise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, here we combine the autoencoder, deconvolution network, and shortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the proposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to the-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases.

Subsequently, to obtain the segmentation of the LV, voxel classification is performed within the defined bounding box using a CNN. The study included CCTA scans of sixty patients, fifty scans were used to train the CNNs for the LV localization, five scans were used to train LV segmentation and the remaining five scans were used for testing the method.

The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset.

First, we use median intensity projection to obtain a 2D patch corresponding to each dimension.

In order to increase the number of training samples, we perform data augmentation by scaling, rotating and adding noise to the input image. The trained network is used to extract features from the input image followed by a Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain the malignancy score. We also empirically establish the significance of different high level nodule attributes such as calcification, sphericity and others for malignancy determination.

Specifically for computed tomography (CT) images, quantitative image assessment can allow for benchmarking image processing methods and optimization of image acquisition parameters. In this work, large volumes of CT images from phantoms and patients are analyzed using 3 data models that vary in their implementation time complexities. The goal here is to identify the optimal method that scales across data set variabilities for predictive modeling of CT image quality (CTIQ). The first two models rely on spatial segmentation of regions-of-interest (ROIs) and estimate CTIQs in terms of segmented pixel variabilities. The third, convolutional neural network (CNN) model relies on error back-propagation from the training set of images to learn the regions indicative of CTIQ. We observe that for 70/30 data split, the average multi-class classification accuracies for CTIQ prediction using the 3 data models range from 73.6-100% and 50-100% for the phantom and patient CT images, respectively. Using variance of pixels within the segmented ROIs as a CTIQ classification parameter, the spatial segmentation data models are found to be more generalizable that the CNN model. However, the CNN model is found to be more suitable for CT image texture classification in the absence of structural variabilities.

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories.

We propose to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) jointly with an adversarial CNN to estimate routine-dose CT images from low-dose CT images and hence reduce noise. A generator CNN was trained to transform low-dose CT images into routine-dose CT images using voxel-wise loss minimization. An adversarial discriminator CNN was simultaneously trained to distinguish the output of the generator from routinedose CT images. The performance of this discriminator was used as an adversarial loss for the generator. Experiments were performed using CT images of an anthropomorphic phantom containing calcium inserts, as well as patient non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT images. The phantom and patients were scanned at 20% and 100% routine clinical dose. Three training strategies were compared: the first used only voxel-wise loss, the second combined voxel-wise loss and adversarial loss, and the third used only adversarial loss. The results showed that training with only voxel-wise loss resulted in the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio with respect to reference routine-dose images. However, the CNNs trained with adversarial loss captured image statistics of routine-dose images better. Noise reduction improved quantification of low-density calcified inserts in phantom CT images and allowed coronary calcium scoring in low-dose patient CT images with high noise levels. Testing took less than 10 seconds per CT volume. CNN-based low-dose CT noise reduction in the image domain is feasible. Training with an adversarial network improves the CNN’s ability to generate images with an appearance similar to that of reference routine-dose CT images.",10.1109/TMI.2017.2708987,"[u'pubs-permissions@ieee.org.', u'j.m.wolterink@umcutrecht.nl.']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934380,68724252-d9f7-4a06-ab22-11b3aac63233,ieee,1,2017

Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images.

Dense image patch labeling is conducted using two methods: efficient random forest classification on image histogram, location and texture features; and more expensive (but more accurate) deep convolutional neural network classification, on larger image windows (i.e., with more spatial contexts). Over-segmented 2-D CT slices by the simple linear iterative clustering approach are adopted through model/parameter calibration and labeled at the superpixel level for positive (pancreas) or negative (non-pancreas or background) classes. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of 80 manually segmented CT volumes, using six-fold cross-validation. Its performance equals or surpasses other state-of-the-art methods (evaluated by “leave-one-patient-out”), with a dice coefficient of 70.7% and Jaccard index of 57.9%. In addition, the computational efficiency has improved significantly, requiring a - ere 6 ~ 8 min per testing case, versus ≥ 10 h for other methods. The segmentation framework using deep patch labeling confidences is also more numerically stable, as reflected in the smaller performance metric standard deviations. Finally, we implement a multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) approach for pancreas segmentation using the same data set. Under six-fold cross-validation, our bottom-up segmentation method significantly outperforms its MALF counterpart: 70.7±13.0% versus 52.51±20.84% in dice coefficients.",10.1109/TIP.2016.2624198,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727966,975475a1-8261-41b7-b3a8-e1efc59adbd8,ieee,1,2017

However, raw data, e.g., spatial context information from 3D CT images, even without annotation, may contain rich useful information. In this paper, we exploit spatial context information as a source of supervision to solve discrimination tasks for fine-grained body part recognition with conventional 3D CT and MR volumes. The proposed pipeline consists of two steps: 1) pre-train a convolutional network for an auxiliary task of 2D slices ordering in a self-supervised manner; 2) transfer and fine-tune the pre-trained network for fine-grained body part recognition. Without any use of human annotation in the first stage, the pre-trained network can still outperform CNN trained from scratch on CT as well as M-R data. Moreover, by comparing with pre-trained CNN from ImageNet, we discover that the distance between source and target tasks plays a crucial role in transfer learning. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve high accuracy with a slice location estimation error of only a few slices on CT and MR data.

Current state-of-the-art techniques for parsing volumetric medical image data are typically based on machine learning methods that exploit large annotated image databases. Two main challenges need to be addressed, these are the efficiency in scanning high-dimensional parametric spaces and the need for representative image features which require significant efforts of manual engineering. We propose a pipeline for object detection and segmentation in the context of volumetric image parsing, solving a two-step learning problem: anatomical pose estimation and boundary delineation. For this task we introduce Marginal Space Deep Learning (MSDL), a novel framework exploiting both the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces and the automated feature design of Deep Learning (DL) network architectures. In the 3D context, the application of deep learning systems is limited by the very high complexity of the parametrization. More specifically 9 parameters are necessary to describe a restricted affine transformation in 3D, resulting in a prohibitive amount of billions of scanning hypotheses. The mechanism of marginal space learning provides excellent run-time performance by learning classifiers in clustered, high-probability regions in spaces of gradually increasing dimensionality. To further increase computational efficiency and robustness, in our system we learn sparse adaptive data sampling patterns that automatically capture the structure of the input.

The most accurate dating methods use Ultrasound Scan (USS) machines, but these machines are expensive, require trained personnel and cannot always be deployed to remote areas. In the absence of USS, the Ballard Score can be used, which is a manual postnatal dating method. However, this method is highly subjective and results can vary widely depending on the experience of the rater. In this paper, we present an automatic system for postnatal gestational age estimation aimed to be deployed on mobile phones, using small sets of images of a newborn's face, foot and ear. We present a novel two-stage approach that makes the most out of Convolutional Neural Networks trained on small sets of images to predict broad classes of gestational age, and then fuse the outputs of these discrete classes with a baby's weight to make fine-grained predictions of gestational age. On a purpose=collected dataset of 88 babies, experiments show that our approach attains an expected error of 6 days and is three times more accurate than the manual postnatal method (Ballard).

To further improve the detection performance while reducing the computational cost, we propose a cascaded framework under 3D CNNs for the task of CMB detection. We first exploit a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) strategy to retrieve the candidates with high probabilities of being CMBs, and then apply a well-trained 3D CNN discrimination model to distinguish CMBs from hard mimics. Compared with traditional sliding window strategy, the proposed 3D FCN strategy can remove massive redundant computations and dramatically speed up the detection process. We constructed a large dataset with 320 volumetric MR scans and performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed method, which achieved a high sensitivity of 93.16% with an average number of 2.74 false positives per subject, outperforming previous methods using low-level descriptors or 2D CNNs by a significant margin.

The deep CNN can learn high-level relational features from the pairwise protein sequences in a hierarchy by progressively integrating convergent protein property representations from lower levels. Multiple deep CNNs are designed to achieve robust protein structure similarities from different aspects. These relational features are fully connected to the top two Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMS) layer to further extract global relational features, which significantly improve the protein structure prediction.

It is difficult for those schemes to process and analyze enormous data when the medical images continue to increase. Besides, some state of the art deep learning schemes may be strict in the standard of database. This study proposes an effective lung nodule detection scheme based on multi-group patches cut out from the lung images, which are enhanced by the Frangi filter. Through combining two groups of images, a four-channel convolution neural networks (CNN) model is designed to learn the knowledge of radiologists for detecting nodules of four levels.

However, the content and semantics of an image can vary depending on its modality and as such the identification of image modality is an important preliminary step. The key challenge for automatically classifying the modality of a medical image is due to the visual characteristics of different modalities: some are visually distinct while others may have only subtle differences. This challenge is compounded by variations in the appearance of images based on the diseases depicted and a lack of sufficient training data for some modalities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for classifying medical images that uses an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. CNNs are a state-of-the-art image classification technique that learns the optimal image features for a given classification task. We hypothesise that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic image representation and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable higher quality features to be extracted. Our method develops a new feature extractor by fine-tuning CNNs that have been initialized on a large dataset of natural images. The fine-tuning process leverages the generic image features from natural images that are fundamental for all images and optimizes them for the variety of medical imaging modalities. These features are used to train numerous multiclass classifiers whose posterior probabilities are fused to predict the modalities of unseen images. Our experiments on the ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset (30 modalities; 6776 training images, and 4166 test images) show that our ensemble of fine-tuned CNNs achieves a higher accuracy than established CNNs.

We address this problem by presenting a looped deep pseudo-task optimization (LDPO) framework for joint mining of deep CNN features and image labels. Our method is conceptually simple and rests upon the hypothesized ""convergence"" of better labels leading to better trained CNN models which in turn feed more discriminative image representations to facilitate more meaningful clusters/labels. Our proposed method is validated in tackling two important applications: 1) Large-scale medical image annotation has always been a prohibitively expensive and easily-biased task even for well-trained radiologists. Significantly better image categorization results are achieved via our proposed approach compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. 2) Unsupervised scene recognition on representative and publicly available datasets with our proposed technique is examined.

This study explores the possibility of incorporating labeling behavior (viz., labeling latency) in a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) framework in order to improve its performance in the presence of limited labeled data. The problem of “spot” detection in MRI scans is considered in this work. In this two-class problem, (a) labeling behavior is available only during the training phase unlike traditional features that are available both during training and testing; and (b) the labeling behavior is associated with only one class (the positive samples) unlike other side information that is available for all classes. To address these issues, a new CNN architecture referred to as L-CNN is designed. The proposed method utilizes the labeling behavior of the expert to cluster the labeled data into multiple categories; a source CNN is then trained to distinguish between these categories. Next, a transfer learning paradigm is used where a target CNN is initialized using this source CNN and its weights updated with the limited labeled data that is available. Experimental results on an existing MRI database show that the proposed L-CNN performs better than a conventional CNN and, further, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, thereby establishing a new baseline for “spot” detection in MRI.",10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899955,"['InputCi194x4x1@306630', '6630Ci23x3x30@10044100', '44100Ci34x4x100@20011200']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899955,c7ad23f1-f9ae-4bd0-96d2-583514f4e2b0,ieee,1,2016

Currently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is a state-of-the-art method for DDI extraction. One limitation of CNN is that it neglects long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, which may be helpful for DDI extraction. In order to incorporate the long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, in this work, we propose a dependency-based convolutional neural network (DCNN) for DDI extraction.

To reduce error propagation, we design a simple rule to combine CNN with DCNN, that is, using DCNN to extract DDIs in short sentences and CNN to extract DDIs in long distances as most dependency parsers work well for short sentences but bad for long sentences.

To cope with this problem we propose a novel weakly-supervised learning method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The advantage of the proposed method over conventional supervised approaches is that only image-level semantic annotations are used in the training process, instead of pixel-level graphic annotations. This can drastically reduce the required annotation effort. Its advantage over the few state-of-the-art weakly-supervised CNN architectures is its simplicity. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in the context of computer-aided detection of inflammatory gastrointestinal lesions in wireless capsule endoscopy videos.

Due to the high complexity of biological vasculature trees, manual identification is often too time-consuming and tedious to be used in practice. To design an automated and computerized method, a major challenge is that the appearance of vasculatures in medical images has great variance across modalities and subjects. Therefore, most existing approaches are specially designed for a particular task, lacking the flexibility to be adapted to other circumstances.

Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration.

For example, most human identity information exists in the image patches containing human faces. The same situation stays in medical images as well. “Bodypart identity” of a transversal slice-which bodypart the slice comes from-is often indicated by local image information, e.g., a cardiac slice and an aorta arch slice are only differentiated by the mediastinum region. In this work, we design a multi-stage deep learning framework for image classification and apply it on bodypart recognition. Specifically, the proposed framework aims at: 1) discover the local regions that are discriminative and non-informative to the image classification problem, and 2) learn a image-level classifier based on these local regions. We achieve these two tasks by the two stages of learning scheme, respectively. In the pre-train stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is learned in a multi-instance learning fashion to extract the most discriminative and and non-informative local patches from the training slices. In the boosting stage, the pre-learned CNN is further boosted by these local patches for image classification. The CNN learned by exploiting the discriminative local appearances becomes more accurate than those learned from global image context. The key hallmark of our method is that it automatically discovers the discriminative and non-informative local patches through multi-instance deep learning. Thus, no manual annotation is required.

The dynamic CNN is fine-tuned by deep tuning with the first frame and shallow tuning with the rest of frames, respectively, to adapt to the individual fetus.

The accuracy and robustness of brain extraction, therefore, is crucial for the accuracy of the entire brain analysis process. State-of-the-art brain extraction techniques rely heavily on the accuracy of alignment or registration between brain atlases and query brain anatomy, and/or make assumptions about the image geometry; therefore have limited success when these assumptions do not hold or image registration fails. With the aim of designing an accurate, learning-based, geometry-independent and registration-free brain extraction tool in this study, we present a technique based on an auto-context convolutional neural network (CNN), in which intrinsic local and global image features are learned through 2D patches of different window sizes. We consider two different architectures: 1) a voxelwise approach based on three parallel 2D convolutional pathways for three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) that implicitly learn 3D image information without the need for computationally expensive 3D convolutions, and 2) a fully convolutional network based on the U-net architecture. Posterior probability maps generated by the networks are used iteratively as context information along with the original image patches to learn the local shape and connectedness of the brain to extract it from non-brain tissue. The brain extraction results we have obtained from our CNNs are superior to the recently reported results in the literature on two publicly available benchmark datasets, namely LPBA40 and OASIS, in which we obtained Dice overlap coefficients of 97.73% and 97.62%, respectively. Significant improvement was achieved via our auto-context algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our algorithm in the challenging problem of extracting arbitrarily-oriented fetal brains in reconstructed fe- al brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. In this application our voxelwise auto-context CNN performed much better than the other methods (Dice coefficient: 95.97%), where the other methods performed poorly due to the non-standard orientation and geometry of the fetal brain in MRI. Through training, our method can provide accurate brain extraction in challenging applications.

This preprocessing step is expected to remove noises in the data, thereby leading to improved reconstruction results. In this paper, we proposed to use 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting the neuronal microscopy images. Specifically, we designed a novel CNN architecture, that takes volumetric images as the inputs and their voxel-wise segmentation maps as the outputs. The developed architecture allows us to train and predict using large microscopy images in an end-to-end manner.

While techniques like whole-slide imaging have enabled computer assisted analysis for exhaustive reporting of the tissue section, it has also given rise to the big-data deluge and the time complexity associated with processing GBs of image data acquired over multiple magnifications. Since preliminary screening of a slide into benign or malignant carried out on the fly during the digitization process can reduce a Pathologist's work load, to devote more time for detailed analysis, slide screening has to be performed on the fly with high sensitivity.

Further a majority voting based approach is used for slide level diagnosis, i.e., the class posteriori estimate of each views at a particular magnification is obtained from the magnification specific CNN, and subsequently posteriori estimate across random multi-views at multi-magnification are voting filtered to provide a slide level diagnosis.

Finally, the FV encoded representations are classified for diagnosis using a linear SVM. Compared with traditional low-level visual features based recognition approaches, our scheme is simpler and requires no complex preprocessing.

Modeling tfMRI data is challenging due to at least two problems: the lack of the ground truth of underlying neural activity and the highly complex intrinsic structure of tfMRI data. To better understand brain networks based on fMRI data, data-driven approaches have been proposed, for instance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL). However, both ICA and SDL only build shallow models, and they are under the strong assumption that original fMRI signal could be linearly decomposed into time series components with their corresponding spatial maps. As growing evidence shows that human brain function is hierarchically organized, new approaches that can infer and model the hierarchical structure of brain networks are widely called for. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has drawn much attention, in that deep CNN has proven to be a powerful method for learning high-level and mid-level abstractions from low-level raw data. Inspired by the power of deep CNN, in this study, we developed a new neural network structure based on CNN, called Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE), in order to take the advantages of both data-driven approach and CNN’s hierarchical feature abstraction ability for the purpose of learning mid-level and high-level features from complex, large-scale tfMRI time series in an unsupervised manner.

The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening.

However, estimation of multitype cardiac indices with consistently reliable and high accuracy is still a great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structures and complexity of temporal dynamics in cardiac MR sequences. While efforts have been devoted into cardiac volumes estimation through feature engineering followed by a independent regression model, these methods suffer from the vulnerable feature representation and incompatible regression model. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated method for multitype cardiac indices estimation. After manual labelling of two landmarks for ROI cropping, an integrated deep neural network Indices-Net is designed to jointly learn the representation and regression models. It comprises two tightly-coupled networks: a deep convolution autoencoder (DCAE) for cardiac image representation, and a multiple output convolution neural network (CNN) for indices regression. Joint learning of the two networks effectively enhances the expressiveness of image representation with respect to cardiac indices, and the compatibility between image representation and indices regression, thus leading to accurate and reliable estimations for all the cardiac indices. When applied with five-fold cross validation on MR images of 145 subjects, Indices-Net achieves consistently low estimation error for LV wall thicknesses (1.440.71mm) and areas of cavity and myocardium (204133mm2). It outperforms, with significant error reductions, segmentation method (55.1% and 17.4%) and two-phase direct volume-only methods (12.7% and 14.6%) for wall thicknesses and areas, respectively.

We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier.

Clinically, knee OA severity is assessed using Kellgren & Lawrence (KL) grades, a five point scale. Previous work on automatically predicting KL grades from radiograph images were based on training shallow classifiers using a variety of hand engineered features. We demonstrate that classification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images.

Traditionally, clinical experts manually categorize the images captured into different skin layers. This time-consuming labeling task impedes the convenient analysis of skin image datasets. In recent automated image recognition tasks, deep learning with convolutional neural nets (CNN) has achieved remarkable results. However in many clinical settings, training data is often limited and insufficient for CNN training. For recognition of RCM skin images, we demonstrate that a CNN trained on a moderate size dataset leads to low accuracy. We introduce a hybrid deep learning approach which uses traditional texton-based feature vectors as input to train a deep neural network. This hybrid method uses fixed filters in the input layer instead of tuned filters, yet superior performance is achieved.

In this work, a specimen pattern recognition system combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pattern histogram was proposed.

Two strategies were designed to predicted the pattern of a whole specimen: 1) the most dominant cell pattern in pattern histogram was represented as the specimen pattern, 2) the pattern histograms were employed as bags of patterns and then were trained and predicted separately by a SVM classifier.

However, these methods can easily fall into overfitting, since a huge number of parameters must be learned. Having bigger datasets may act as regularization and lead to better models.

The involuntary movements of subjects frequently infuse motion artifacts to SD-OCT images. Sub-sampling of signals is introduced in imaging protocol to avoid such artifacts which causes fall in spatial resolution and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Sparse coding (SC) is opted for restoration and rectification of complete signals from sparse samples through constructing complete and sparse space dictionaries independently. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be casted as SC for jointly learning dictionaries resulting less number of CNN filters (equivalence of SC dictionaries) to be trained. The proposed approach extends the separable filters to CNN through architectural constrain. This results in a parallel architecture and reduced number of parameters without compromising on performance.

In this paper, a deep learning based feature extraction method by convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for automated mitosis detection for cancer diagnosis and grading by histopathological images. The proposed framework is tested on the MITOS data set provided for a contest on mitosis detection in breast cancer histological images released for research purposes in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'2014). By using provided histopathological images, cellular structures are initially found by combined clustering based segmentation and blob analysis after preprocessing step. Then, obtained cellular image patches are cropped automatically from the histopathological images for feature extraction stage. CNN, which is a prominent deep learning method on image processing tasks, is utilized for extracting discriminative features. Due to the high dimensional output of the CNN, combination of PCA and LDA dimension reduction methods are performed respectively for regularization and dimension reduction process. Afterwards, a robust kernel based classifier, support vector machine (SVM), is used for final classification of mitotic and non-mitotic cells. The test results on MITOS data set prove that the proposed framework achieved promising results for mitosis detection on histopathological images.",10.1109/CINTI.2016.7846429,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846429,83c8fb33-ea55-44f0-b4cf-039966c1cdac,ieee,1,2016

Specifically, we generate a putative label for each unlabeled sample regularized with a graph-smooth term, which are used as if they were true labels.

However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches.

For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable, offering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However, each CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each of these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic ultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI) in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT. These operations are tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the widespread utilization of CIMT in clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate CIMT video interpretation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system performs reliably. The reliable performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) coupled with our informative image representation and effective post-processing of the CNN outputs, which are uniquely designed for each of the above three operations.",10.1109/CVPR.2016.277,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780646,88d41e22-36fd-4439-b7cd-226070788421,ieee,1,2016

These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels.

Two principal factors make this task difficult: firstly, the presence of speckle noise arising from the interference that accompanies all coherent imaging approaches; secondly, the sometimes subtle interaction between musculoskeletal components that leads to non-uniformity of the image intensity. Our work presents an investigation of the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address both of these problems. CNNs are an effective tool that has previously been used in image processing of several biomedical imaging modalities. However, there is little published material addressing the processing of musculoskeletal ultrasound images. In our work we explore the effectiveness of CNNs when trained to act as a pre-segmentation pixel classifier that determines whether a pixel is an edge or non-edge pixel. Our CNNs are trained using two different ground truth interpretations. The first one uses an automatic Canny edge detector to provide the ground truth image; the second ground truth was obtained using the same image marked-up by an expert anatomist. In this initial study the CNNs have been trained using half of the prepared data from one image, using the other half for testing; validation was also carried out using three unseen ultrasound images. CNN performance was assessed using Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy.

This results in more captured contextual information, which is in particular of interest for biomedical image analysis, where the anatomical location of imaging features are often crucial. We evaluate and compare this strategy for white matter hyperintensity segmentation on a test set of 46 MRI scans.

Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 ×3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images.

Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner.

The combined CNN/SVAR approach using BP time-series achieved a median and interquartile-range AUC of 0.74 [0.69, 0.75], significantly outperforming CNN-alone (0.54 [0.46, 0.59]), and SVAR-alone with logistic regression (0.69 [0.65, 0.72]).

But it is hard for clinicians to accurately detect gastrointestinal disease due to its great dependence on doctors experiences. Therefore, a computer-aided lesion detection system can offer great help for clinicians. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for endoscopy image lesion detection. A trainable feature extractor based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to get more generic features for endoscopy images.

Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.",10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274740,c065a832-a9d5-4091-88ca-a783f59bd2a7,ieee,1,2016

Each molecule can be represented by a unique neural connectivity problem (graph) which can be programmed onto a Cellular Neural Network. The idea was to translate chemical structures like small organic molecules or peptides into a self learning environment which is CNN based. In the case of small molecules, each cell of the CNN stands for one atom of the molecule under consideration. But in contrast to the standard CNN architecture where each cell is connected to the neighboring cells, only those cells of the feature net are connected for which there also exists a chemical bond in the molecule under consideration. This implies that the feature net topology varies from molecule to molecule. In the case of peptides, the amino acids that form the building blocks of the peptide are reflected by the CNN cells wherein the amino acid sequence defines the network topology. Unlike the standard CNN used for image processing, there are no input values like the input image that are fed into the feature net. Instead, all information about the input molecule is supplied to the feature net by means of the topology. The output of several feature nets is fed into a supervisor neural network which computes the final output value. The combination of several feature nets and a supervisor networks constitutes the Molecular Graph Network (MGN).

Previous ISBI contest results and related research show that Convolution Neural Network(CNN)has high classification accuracy in EM image segmentation. Besides it eliminates the pain of extracting complex features which's indispensable for traditional classification algorithms. However CNN's extremely time-consuming and fault vulnerability due to long time execution prevent it from being widely used in practice. In this paper, we try to address these problems by providing reliable high performance CNN framework for medial image segmentation. Our CNN has light weighted user level checkpoint, which costs seconds when doing one checkpoint and restart. On the fact of lacking in platform diversity in current parallel CNN framework, our CNN system tries to make it general by providing distributed cross-platform parallelism implementation. Currently we have integrated Theano's GPU implementation in our CNNsystem, and we explore parallelism potential on multi-core CPUs and many-core Intel Phi by testing performance of main kernel functions of CNN. In the future, we will integrate implementation son other two platforms into our CNN framework.",10.1109/CCGrid.2015.108,"[u'zhangxiuxia@ict.ac.cn', u'tgm@ict.ac.cn', u'cmy@ict.ac.cn', u'16@30X30', u'16@15X15', u'16@12X12', u'16@6X6']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152555,f6db039a-47d4-4ad7-9b2a-2bcd70d94be0,ieee,1,2015

The heading side effect of this difficulty seeing is the exudates. Exudates are the melted watery grasping solutes, proteins, cells, or cell garbage spilled from the harmed veins into near by tissues or on tissue surfaces in the retina.

It is important that the anomaly detection algorithms are not confused by these objects. To achieve this goal, the authors propose an approach to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect chest tubes present on radiographs. To detect the chest tube skeleton as the final output in a better manner, non-uniform rational B-spline curves are used to automatically fit with the CNN output. This is the first study conducted to automatically detect artificial objects in the lung region of chest radiographs. Other automatic detection schemes work on the mediastinum.

State-of-the-art methods often show high sensitivities at the cost of high false-positives (FP) per patient rates. We design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework that first operates a candidate generation system at sensitivities ~ 100% of but at high FP levels. By leveraging existing CADe systems, coordinates of regions or volumes of interest (ROI or VOI) are generated and function as input for a second tier, which is our focus in this study. In this second stage, we generate 2D (two-dimensional) or 2.5D views via sampling through scale transformations, random translations and rotations. These random views are used to train deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifiers. In testing, the ConvNets assign class (e.g., lesion, pathology) probabilities for a new set of random views that are then averaged to compute a final per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a highly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving high sensitivities. The methods are evaluated on three data sets: 59 patients for sclerotic metastasis detection, 176 patients for lymph node detection, and 1,186 patients for colonic polyp detection. Experimental results show the ability of ConvNets to generalize well to different medical imaging CADe applications and scale elegantly to various data sets.

The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation.

The proposed approach consists of three main steps. In the first step, the prostate is localized and segmented based on a new level-set model. This model is guided by a stochastic speed function that is derived using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The NMF attributes are calculated using information from the MRI intensity, a probabilistic shape model, and the spatial interactions between prostate voxels. In the second step, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the segmented prostate volume is mathematically calculated for different b-values. To preserve continuity, the calculated ADC values are normalized and refined using a Generalized Gauss-Markov Random Field (GGMRF) image model. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of refined ADC for the prostate tissues at different b-values are then constructed. These CDFs are considered as global features which can be used to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Finally, a deep learning auto-encoder network, trained by a non-negativity constraint algorithm (NCAE), is used to classify the prostate tumor as benign or malignant based on the CDFs extracted from the previous step. Preliminary experiments on 42 clinical DW-MRI data sets resulted in 97.6% correct classification (sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 95.24%), indicating the high accuracy of the proposed framework.",10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493490,[u'aselba01@exchange.louisville.eduBecauseofthesideeffectsofthepreviouslymentionedtech-niques'],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493490,29235c08-dd06-43e2-b7e2-985c7fcb7004,ieee,1,2016

However, the success of most traditional classification methods relies on the presence of accurate cell segmentations. Despite sixty years of research in this field, accurate segmentation remains a challenge in the presence of cell clusters and pathologies. Moreover, previous classification methods are only built upon the extraction of hand-crafted features, such as morphology and texture. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a method to directly classify cervical cells – without prior segmentation – based on deep features, using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). First, the ConvNet is pre-trained on a natural image dataset. It is subsequently fine-tuned on a cervical cell dataset consisting of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely centered on the nuclei. In the testing phase, aggregation is used to average the prediction scores of a similar set of image patches. The proposed method is evaluated on both Pap smear and LBC datasets. Results show that our method outperforms previous algorithms in classification accuracy (98.3%), area under the curve (AUC) (0.99) values, and especially specificity (98.3%), when applied to the Herlev benchmark Pap smear dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation.

Most of the current LV segmentation methods are semi-automated and require error prone manual initialization. A fully-automated LV segmentation method would expedite the functional analysis of the LV, reduce subjectivity and improve patient experience. We automatically segment the LV wall in cardiac MRI images with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN).

The contrast in performance between the dilated network and its competitors becomes obvious when both are tested on a large dataset of unprocessed human brain volumes.

In this work we present a novel framework to automatically characterize the malignancy of HCC lesions from DWI images. We predict HCC malignancy in two steps: As a first step we automatically segment HCC tumor lesions using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCN). A 3D neural network (SurvivalNet) then predicts the HCC lesions' malignancy from the HCC tumor segmentation. We formulate this task as a classification problem with classes being “low risk” and “high risk” represented by longer or shorter survival times than the median survival. We evaluated our method on DWI of 31 HCC patients. Our proposed framework achieves an end-to-end accuracy of 65% with a Dice score for the automatic lesion segmentation of 69% and an accuracy of 68% for tumor malignancy classification based on expert annotations. We compared the SurvivalNet to classical handcrafted features such as Histogram and Haralick and show experimentally that SurvivalNet outperforms the handcrafted features in HCC malignancy classification.

Using a common architecture (such as AlexNet) provides quite good results, but not sufficient for clinical use. Improving the model is not an easy task, due to the large number of hyper-parameters governing both the architecture and the training of the network, and to the limited understanding of their relevance. Since an exhaustive search is not tractable, we propose to optimize the network first by random search, and then by an adaptive search based on Gaussian Processes and Probability of Improvement.

Clinical risk prediction of ACS is important for early intervention and treatment. Existing ACS risk scoring models are based mainly on a small set of hand-picked risk factors and often dichotomize predictive variables to simplify the score calculation [1-3]. Methods: This study develops a regularized stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) model to stratify clinical risks of ACS patients from a large volume of electronic health records (EHR). To capture characteristics of patients at similar risk levels, and preserve the discriminating information across different risk levels, two constraints are added on SDAE to make the reconstructed feature representations contain more risk information of patients, which contribute to a better clinical risk prediction result. Results: We validate our approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 3,464 ACS patient samples.

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error.

In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers) can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for accurate skin lesion segmentation, and further enhance its capability by incorporating a multi-scale contextual information integration scheme. Finally, we seamlessly integrate the proposed FCRN (for segmentation) and other very deep residual networks (for classification) to form a two-stage framework. This framework enables the classification network to extract more representative and specific features based on segmented results instead of the whole dermoscopy images, further alleviating the insufficiency of training data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on ISBI 2016 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed framework, ranking the first in classification and the second in segmentation among 25 teams and 28 teams, r- spectively.

The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues.

Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extrajudicial surveillance.

However, most work to date has investigated the binary classification problem for predicting the onset of one chronic disease, but little attention has been given to assessing risk of developing comorbidities that are major causes of morbidity and mortality. For example, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease frequently accompany congestive heart failure. This paper is motivated by the problem of predicting comorbid diseases and aims to answer the following question: can we predict the comorbid risk using a patient's medical history? We propose a new predictive learning framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), that represents EHRs as graphs with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, and medication), and then develop a novel deep learning methodology for risk prediction of multiple comorbid diseases. The main innovation of the framework is that it defines the distance between the heterogeneous attributes of the graph representation extracted from the EHR and develops an appropriate learning infrastructure that is a composition of sparse convolutional layers and local pooling steps that match with the local structure of the space of the heterogeneous attributes. As a result, the new method is capable of capturing features about the relationships between heterogeneous attributes of the graphs.

The development and validation of these hypoxia-modified therapies depend on an effective way of measuring tumor hypoxia, but a standardized measurement is currently unavailable in clinical practice. Different types of manual measurements have been proposed in clinical research, but in this paper we focus on a recently published approach that quantifies the number and proportion of hypoxic regions using high resolution (immuno-)fluorescence (IF) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained images of a histological specimen of a tumor. We introduce new machine learning-based methodologies to automate this measurement, where the main challenge is the fact that the clinical annotations available for training the proposed methodologies consist of the total number of normoxic, chronically hypoxic, and acutely hypoxic regions without any indication of their location in the image. Therefore, this represents a weakly-supervised structured output classification problem, where training is based on a high-order loss function formed by the norm of the difference between the manual and estimated annotations mentioned above. We propose four methodologies to solve this problem: 1) a naive method that uses a majority classifier applied on the nodes of a fixed grid placed over the input images; 2) a baseline method based on a structured output learning formulation that relies on a fixed grid placed over the input images; 3) an extension to this baseline based on a latent structured output learning formulation that uses a graph that is flexible in terms of the amount and positions of nodes; and 4) a pixel-wise labeling based on a fully-convolutional neural network. Using a data set of 89 weakly annotated pairs of IF and HE images from eight tumors, we show that the quantitativ- results of methods (3) and (4) above are equally competitive and superior to the naive (1) and baseline (2) methods.

This paper presents the design and implementation of GPU accelerated deep convolutional neural networks to automatically diagnose and thereby classify high-resolution retinal images into 5 stages of the disease based on severity.

Breast arterial calcifications (BACs), detected in mammograms, can be useful risk markers associated with the disease. We investigate the feasibility of automated and accurate detection of BACs in mammograms for risk assessment of coronary artery disease. We develop a 12-layer convolutional neural network to discriminate BAC from non-BAC and apply a pixelwise, patch-based procedure for BAC detection. To assess the performance of the system, we conduct a reader study to provide ground-truth information using the consensus of human expert radiologists. We evaluate the performance using a set of 840 full-field digital mammograms from 210 cases, using both free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis and calcium mass quantification analysis. The FROC analysis shows that the deep learning approach achieves a level of detection similar to the human experts. The calcium mass quantification analysis shows that the inferred calcium mass is close to the ground truth, with a linear regression between them yielding a coefficient of determination of 96.24%.

One major carrier for conducting patient similarity research is the Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are usually heterogeneous, longitudinal, and sparse. Though existing studies on learning patient similarity from EHRs have shown being useful in solving real clinical problems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medical interpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume a vector based representation for patients, which typically requires aggregation of medical events over a certain time period. As aconsequence, the temporal information will be lost. In this paper, we propose a patient similarity evaluation framework based on temporal matching of longitudinal patient EHRs. Two efficient methods are presented, unsupervised and supervised, both of which preserve the temporal properties in EHRs.

However, there is still need for more efficient and reliable approaches to successful diagnosis of the disease. This research used deep learning framework with modified k-sparse autoencoder (oKSA) classification to locate neutrally degenerated areas of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low amyloid beta 1-42 imaging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid; each with a sample of 150 images. Results show a correlation between computational demarcation of infected regions and the images. Degeneration in the studied areas was evidenced by high phosphorylated t-/p-tau levels in CSF, regional fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and the presence of atrophy patterns. The use of σKSA algorithm in boosting classification helped to improve the classifier performance.

Subjective segmentations are widely adopted in clinical diagnosis and treating, but they are neither accurate nor reliable. An automatical and objective system for brain tumor segmentation is strongly expected. But they are still facing some challenges such as lower segmentation accuracy, demanding a priori knowledge or requiring the human intervention. In this paper, a novel and new coarse-to-fine method is proposed to segment the brain tumor. This hierarchical framework consists of preprocessing, deep learning network based classification and post-processing. The preprocessing is used to extract image patches for each MR image and obtains the gray level sequences of image patches as the input of the deep learning network. The deep learning network based classification is implemented by a stacked auto-encoder network to extract the high level abstract feature from the input, and utilizes the extracted feature to classify image patches. After mapping the classification result to a binary image, the post-processing is implemented by a morphological filter to get the final segmentation result. In order to evaluate the proposed method, the experiment was applied to segment the brain tumor for the real patient dataset. The final performance shows that the proposed brain tumor segmentation method is more accurate and efficient.",10.1109/ICCABS.2016.7802771,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7802771,4ec9f005-787c-4dde-8cf7-e1ed3f9e3c39,ieee,1,2016

Our model uses a dynamic statistical shape model comprised of training shapes from select weighted subsets of the feature subspace. Subsets are chosen during the iterative segmentation process according to a latent temporal component allocation variable, determined from joint deep features and LV landmark information using a Dirichlet process mixture model with Chinese restaurant process prior.

Moreover, our network can not only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating.

The SSAE learns high-level features from pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of MA. The high-level features learned by SSAE are fed into a classifier to categorize each image patch as MA or non-MA. The public benchmark DIARETDB is utilized to provide the training/testing data and ground truth. Among the 89 images, totally 2182 image patches with MA lesions, serve as positive data, and another 6230 image patches without MA lesions are generated by a randomly sliding window operation, to serve as negative data. Without any blood vessel removal or complicated preprocessing operations, SSAE learned directly from the raw image patches, and automatically extracted the distinguishing features to classify the patches using Softmax Classifier.

Especially, deep learning has great superiority in image analysis and disease prediction. In this paper, we use Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as an example to show advantages of deep learning in diagnosing brain diseases and providing clinical decision support. Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), about 25% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The e-health field becomes more complete and effective owing to that.

The detection of masses from mammograms is considered to be a challenging problem due to their large variation in shape, size, boundary and texture and also because of their low signal to noise ratio compared to the surrounding breast tissue. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting masses in mammograms using a cascade of deep learning and random forest classifiers. The first stage classifier consists of a multi-scale deep belief network that selects suspicious regions to be further processed by a two-level cascade of deep convolutional neural networks. The regions that survive this deep learning analysis are then processed by a two-level cascade of random forest classifiers that use morphological and texture features extracted from regions selected along the cascade. Finally, regions that survive the cascade of random forest classifiers are combined using connected component analysis to produce state-of-the-art results.

The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by 1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and 2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of “Deep Learning” strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 × 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83%.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a typical example is starting to be analyzed with facial expressions videos to detect emotions. Emotions play an important role in the daily life of human beings, the need and importance of automatic emotion recognition has grown with increasing role of human computer interface applications. In this paper, we concentrate on recognition of the emotions jointly from ""inner"" and ""outer"" reactions, which are electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and facial expression video. Due to the streaming nature of this problem, the data volume and velocity is very challenging. We address these challenges from the theoretic perspective and propose a real time algorithm based on EEG signals and synchronized facial video to learn feature vector jointly. Our algorithm consists of an unsupervisedly EEG dictionary component based on deep learning theorem, and a probability pooling component transforms a continuous sequential signal into an EEG ""sentence"" which consists of a sequence of EEG words. The EEG sentence is then jointly learned with video features into a new fixed length feature representation for emotion classification. We overcome several computational challenges on the data based on the idea of convolution and pooling, and we conduct extensive evaluation for each component of our model. We also demonstrate the state-of-the-art classification result on real-world dataset.

Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow.

Deep learning algorithm provides a solution with a pre-training way using three layers of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Thus, we can use epochs of all subjects to pre-training the deep network, and use back-propagation to fine tuning the network subject by subject.

Volumetric segmentation of such small and complex structure, which is elusive in clinical MRI protocols, is thereby a pre-requisite process for reliable DBS direct targeting. While direct visualization of the STN is facilitated with advanced ultrahigh-field MR imaging (7 Tesla), such high fields are not always clinically available. In this paper, we aim at the automatic prediction of the STN region on clinical low-field MRI, exploiting dependencies between the STN and its adjacent structures, learned from ultrahigh-field MRI. We present a framework based on a statistical shape model to learn such shape relationship on high quality MR data sets. This allows for an accurate prediction and visualization of the STN structure, given detectable predictors on the low-field MRI.

In this paper, we first report a user study on the information needs of health seekers in terms of questions and then select those that ask for possible diseases of their manifested symptoms for further analytic. We next propose a novel deep learning scheme to infer the possible diseases given the questions of health seekers. The proposed scheme is comprised of two key components. The first globally mines the discriminant medical signatures from raw features. The second deems the raw features and their signatures as input nodes in one layer and hidden nodes in the subsequent layer, respectively. Meanwhile, it learns the inter-relations between these two layers via pre-training with pseudo-labeled data. Following that, the hidden nodes serve as raw features for the more abstract signature mining.

Clinically too, sleep apnea is identified using a combination of markers including blood oxygen saturation, respiration rate etc. More recently, scientists have begun to investigate the use of instantaneous heart rates for detection and severity measurement of sleep apnea. However, the best-known techniques that use heart rate and its derivatives have been able to achieve less than 85% accuracy in classifying minute-to-minute apnea data. In our research reported in this paper, we apply a deep learning technique called LSTM-RNN (long short-term memory recurrent neural network) for identification of sleep apnea and its severity based only on instantaneous heart rates. We have tested this model on multiple sleep apnea datasets and obtained perfect accuracy. Furthermore, we have also tested its robustness on an arrhythmia dataset (that is highly probable in mimicking sleep apnea heart rate variability) and found that the model is highly accurate in distinguishing between the two.",10.1109/BHI.2017.7897263,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897263,b89928a5-6ea0-4273-9bf8-fc1a44b1578b,ieee,1,2017

Whereas currently trending deep neural networks in speech recognition or computer vision use up to a million of training samples, a restricted set of only 3,153 heart sound recordings is available as training data. We workaround this limitation by artificially increasing the training set by means of augmentation of the raw PCGs using various audio effects.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proven to be very successful for modelling sequences of data in many areas of Machine Learning. In this work we present an approach based on RNNs, specifically designed for the clinical domain, that combines static and dynamic information in order to predict future events. We work with a database collected in the Charité Hospital in Berlin that contains complete information concerning patients that underwent a kidney transplantation. After the transplantation three main endpoints can occur: rejection of the kidney, loss of the kidney and death of the patient. Our goal is to predict, based on information recorded in the Electronic Health Record of each patient, whether any of those endpoints will occur within the next six or twelve months after each visit to the clinic. We compared different types of RNNs that we developed for this work, with a model based on a Feedforward Neural Network and a Logistic Regression model.

It is extensively used in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and can be used for disease diagnosis, disease treatment, etc. The two main technologies of EEG signal analysis is feature extraction and pattern recognition. The key features of EEG signals can be obtained through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The wavelet analysis is one kind of time-frequency analysis and has been considered very promising for data compression. The conventional method find wavelet synopsis to minimize the total mean squared error (L2). It cannot control the approximation error of each single data element in the data vector. Usually, the nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linears, also more time-consuming in the meantime. In this paper, one method is provided to realize the feature extraction and pattern recognition of EEG signals. The data compression algorithm Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) proposed by Pang et al. takes a novel method to construct unrestricted Haar wavelet synopsis under uniform norm (L∞) error bound. In their algorithm, the maximum approximation error of each individual element can be bounded by an given error bound. We apply this method to EEG signal compression, thus the key features are obtained. Then a fast nonlinear classification algorithm, one Randomize Neural Network (RNN), is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals.

Most temporal inference methods for the dynamics of GRNs assume linear dependencies among genes but this strong assumption of linearity among genes does not truly represent the dynamics of the GRNs which are inherently nonlinear. Other parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems such as the S-systems and causal identification structure (CSI) have been proposed for modeling time-course nonlinearities in GRNs; however, these methods are statistically inefficient and analytically intractable especially in high dimensions. To overcome these problems, we propose an algorithm based on optimized recurrent neural network (RNN) and dynamic Bayesian (DBN) network called RNN-DBN.

To increase prediction accuracy and efficiency, various approaches have been proposed which combine multiple predictors to produce superior results compared to single predictors. Three methods for model fusion are presented and comparatively assessed.

In this technique, the applied physiological inputs are partitioned into predicted (certain) or random (uncertain) parts using defined lower and boundary of rough regions.

Guiraud",IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine. 2014,Muscle Fatigue Tracking with Evoked EMG via Recurrent Neural Network: Toward Personalized Neuroprosthetics,"One of the challenging issues in computational rehabilitation is that there is a large variety of patient situations depending on the type of neurological disorder. Human characteristics are basically subject specific and time variant; for instance, neuromuscular dynamics may vary due to muscle fatigue. To tackle such patient specificity and time-varying characteristics, a robust bio-signal processing and a precise model-based control which can manage the nonlinearity and time variance of the system, would bring break-through and new modality toward computational intelligence (CI) based rehabilitation technology and personalized neuroprosthetics. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a useful technique to assist restoring motor capability of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients by delivering electrical pulses to paralyzed muscles. However, muscle fatigue constraints the application of FES as it results in the time-variant muscle response. To perform adaptive closedloop FES control with actual muscle response feedback taken into account, muscular torque is essential to be estimated accurately. However, inadequacy of the implantable torque sensor limits the direct measurement of the time-variant torque at the joint. This motivates the development of methods to estimate muscle torque from bio-signals that can be measured. Evoked electromyogram (eEMG) has been found to be highly correlated with FES-induced torque under various muscle conditions, indicating that it can be used for torque/force prediction. A nonlinear ARX (NARX) type model is preferred to track the relationship between eEMG and stimulated muscular torque. This paper presents a NARX recurrent neural network (NARX-RNN) model for identification/prediction of FES-induced muscular dynamics with eEMG. The NARX-RNN model may possess novelty of robust prediction performance. Due to the difficulty of choosing a proper forgetting factor of Kalman filter for predicting time-variant torque with eEMG, the presente- NARX-RNN could be considered as an alternative muscular torque predictor. Data collected from five SCI patients is used to evaluate the proposed NARX-RNN model, and the results show promising estimation performances.

Although polypectomy at early stage reduces CRC incidence, 90% of the polyps are small and diminutive, where removal of them poses risks to patients that may outweigh the benefits. Correctly detecting and predicting polyp type during colonoscopy allows endoscopists to resect and discard the tissue without submitting it for histology, saving time, and costs. Nevertheless, human visual observation of early stage polyps varies. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a fully automatic algorithm to detect and classify hyperplastic and adenomatous colorectal polyps. Adenomatous polyps should be removed, whereas distal diminutive hyperplastic polyps are considered clinically insignificant and may be left in situ . A novel transfer learning application is proposed utilizing features learned from big nonmedical datasets with 1.4-2.5 million images using deep convolutional neural network. The endoscopic images we collected for experiment were taken under random lighting conditions, zooming and optical magnification, including 1104 endoscopic nonpolyp images taken under both white-light and narrowband imaging (NBI) endoscopy and 826 NBI endoscopic polyp images, of which 263 images were hyperplasia and 563 were adenoma as confirmed by histology. The proposed method identified polyp images from nonpolyp images in the beginning followed by predicting the polyp histology.

In particular, we combine a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to detect mitotic events in patch sequences. The CNN-LSTM network can be trained end-to-end to simultaneously learn convolutional features within each frame and temporal dynamics between frames, without hand-crafted visual or temporal feature design. Owing to the LSTM layer, this approach is able to detect mitotic events in patch sequences of variable length, as well as making use of longer context information among frames in the sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to detect mitosis using deep learning in both spatial and temporal domains. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM network can be trained efficiently, and we evaluate this design by applying the network to original raw microscopy image sequences to locate mitotic events both spatially and temporally. The data we validate the proposed method on include C3H10 mesenchymal and C2C12 myoblastic stem cell populations. Our approach achieved the F score of 98.72% on the C2C12 dataset, and the F score of 96.5% on the C3H10 dataset.

Scientists focus on brain-inspired intelligence, namely, try to get inspiration from the brain nervous system and cognitive behavior mechanism, to develop intelligent computing models as well as algorithms with stronger information representation, processing and learning ability. So, the study of neurons and the connections between neurons of brain are needed. One major obstacle of reconstruction lies in segmenting and tracking neuronal processes. Electron microscopy is producing neurons images rapidly. In response, we propose an efficient method for neuronal tracking in electron microscopy images to help scientists reconstruct complex neurons.

Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not easily separable by image processing techniques. Many techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification.

These models are developed in the context of microscopy imaging of malignant tumours, where the estimation of the number and proportion of classes of microcirculatory supply units (MCSU) is important in the assessment of the efficacy of common cancer treatments (an MCSU is a region of the tumour tissue supplied by a microvessel). The proposed methodologies take as input multimodal microscopy images of a tumour, and estimate the number and proportion of MCSU classes. This estimation is facilitated by the use of an underlying latent graph (not present in the manual annotations), where each MCSU is represented by a node in this graph, labelled with the MCSU class and image location. The training process uses the manual weak annotations available, consisting of the number of MCSU classes per training image, where the training objective is the minimisation of a high-order loss function based on the norm of the error between the manual and estimated annotations. One of the models proposed is based on a new flexible latent structure support vector machine (FLSSVM) and the other is based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model.

We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device.

Over the past decades, many machine learning approaches have been proposed to identify activities from inertial sensor data for specific applications. Most methods, however, are designed for offline processing rather than processing on the sensor node. In this paper, a human activity recognition technique based on a deep learning methodology is designed to enable accurate and real-time classification for low-power wearable devices. To obtain invariance against changes in sensor orientation, sensor placement, and in sensor acquisition rates, we design a feature generation process that is applied to the spectral domain of the inertial data. Specifically, the proposed method uses sums of temporal convolutions of the transformed input. Accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. A systematic analysis of the feature generation parameters and a comparison of activity recognition computation times on mobile devices and sensor nodes are also presented.",10.1109/BSN.2016.7516235,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516235,5fd784f5-9ab1-4375-86ac-ff12b86a9674,ieee,1,2016

Current deep learning based recognition methods for histology data require collection of large volumes of labeled data in order to train a new neural network when there are changes to the image acquisition procedure. However, it is extremely expensive for pathologists to manually label sufficient volumes of data for each pathology study in a professional manner, which results in limitations in real-world applications.

Inspired by transfer learning, our work assumes that the training data and testing data follow different distributions, and there is an adaptation operation to more accurately estimate the kernels in CNN in feature extraction, in order to enhance performance by transferring knowledge from labeled data in source domain to unlabeled data in target domain.

EEG-based characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages at lower cost in the home. However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which are both uncomfortable and difficult to position. Previous studies of sleep stage scoring that used only frontal electrodes with a hierarchical decision tree motivated this paper, in which we have taken advantage of rectifier neural network for detecting hierarchical features and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for sequential data learning to optimize classification performance with single-channel recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electrooculogram (EOG).

In these settings, the relations between instances and labels are usually ambiguous. In contrast, multi-task learning focuses on the output space in which an input sample is associated with multiple labels. In real world, a sample may be associated with multiple labels that are derived from observing multiple aspects of the problem. Thus many real world applications are naturally formulated as multi-instance multi-task (MIMT) problems. A common approach to MIMT is to solve it task-by-task independently under the multi-instance learning framework. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance in single-instance single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN deals with multi-instance multi-label tasks still remains an open problem. This is mainly due to the complex multiple-to-multiple relations between the input and output space. In this work, we propose a deep leaning model, known as multi-instance multi-task convolutional neural networks (MIMT-CNN), where a number of images representing a multi-task problem is taken as the inputs. Then a shared sub-CNN is connected with each input image to form instance representations. Those sub-CNN outputs are subsequently aggregated as inputs to additional convolutional layers and full connection layers to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. This CNN model, through transfer learning from other domains, enables transfer of prior knowledge at image level learned from large single-label single-task data sets.

With the growing availability of large-scale data sets and advanced computational techniques such as deep learning, researchers can help to usher in a new era of effective genomic medicine.",10.1109/JPROC.2015.2494198,"['mleung@psi.toronto.edu', 'andrew@psi.toronto.edu', 'babak@psi.toronto.edu', 'frey@psi.toronto.edu']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347331,ccc76140-0d17-427f-8997-24fe2c5ab973,ieee,1,2016

Zeng",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. 2015,Integrative Data Analysis of Multi-Platform Cancer Data with a Multimodal Deep Learning Approach,"Identification of cancer subtypes plays an important role in revealing useful insights into disease pathogenesis and advancing personalized therapy. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personali- ed cancer therapy.",10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729,[u'zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.'],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977954,9ab00253-0f16-4253-ac08-1964cd6f674e,ieee,1,2015

Original feature selection methods choose genes/miRNAs based on their individual features regardless of how they perform together. Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes. Experimental results show that the approach was able to outperform classical feature selection methods in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 9%, lung cancer by 6% and breast cancer by around 10% in F1-measure. Results also show the enhancement in F1-measure of our approach over recently related work in [1] and [2].",10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944490,"[u'Egyptrania.ibrahim.salama@gmail.com', u'noha.yousri@alexu.edu.eg', u'drmaismail@gmail.comandnagwamakky']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944490,93bda710-be40-4d8f-ac5d-c8466624088d,ieee,1,2014

To better understand miRNAs, the miRNA regulatory mechanism needs to be investigated and the real targets identified. Here, we present miRTDL, a new miRNA target prediction algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN automatically extracts essential information from the input data rather than completely relying on the input dataset generated artificially when the precise miRNA target mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, the constraint relaxing method is first used to construct a balanced training dataset to avoid inaccurate predictions caused by the existing unbalanced dataset. The miRTDL is then applied to 1,606 experimentally validated miRNA target pairs. Finally, the results show that our miRTDL outperforms the existing target prediction algorithms and achieves significantly higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 88.43, 96.44, and 89.98 percent, respectively.

In this paper, we examine the potential of using a deep learning framework, a convolutional neural network (CNN), for such a prediction. To facilitate the CNN learning, we explore the structure of abundance profiles by creating the phylogenetic tree and by designing a scheme to embed the tree to a matrix that retains the spatial relationship of nodes in the tree and their quantitative characteristics.

PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes. Extensive experiments using real-world databases, such as METABRIC and NKI, show promising results in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers, for classifying tumors and predicting events like recurrence and metastasis.",10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196,"[u'khademm@mcmaster.ca', u'nedialk@mcmaster.ca']",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424407,fc623d04-b5cd-498b-a479-1b35c81c318f,ieee,1,2015

In this paper, by constructing a multilayer restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) deep network, we use the genomic data (i.e., SNP data) for unsupervised feature learning and disease diagnosis of schizophrenia. In order to obtain some more accurate diagnosis results by RBMs, firstly, we transform the SNP data into binary sequences, and then by training the multi-layer RBMs deep network on unlabeled data, the multi-level abstract features of the genomic data are obtained and stored in the network. Finally, by adding a linear classifier to the top of the multi-layer RBMs deep network, the classification results on the testing data are gained. The results show that the average performance of this method is better than that of other methods, e.g., SVM (including linear SVM as well as SVM with multilayer perceptron kernel), sparse representations based classifier and k-nearest neighbors method.

Sequence data from the well studied model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been commonly used to test and validate in silico prediction methods. DNA replication is a critical step in the cellular process and the sequence location where this process originates in the genomic landscape is generally referred as origin of replication. In this paper we investigate the application bidirectional Long Short Term (LSTM) Networks to predict origin of replication sequences. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have recently been shown to yield state of the art performance in speech recognition, and music generation. These networks are capable of learning long term patterns via the use of multiplication gates. This paper utilizes Deep bidirectional LSTM for prediction of origin of replication sequences belonging to the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results demonstrate that LSTMs outperform the commonly used machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
