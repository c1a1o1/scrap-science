# scrap-science
A bunch of Jupyter notebooks to scrap some of the most popular web platforms for scientific papers.


## IEEE
1. Go to http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
2. Enter keywords and download .csv
3. Combine and clean the multiple downloaded .csv's using combine_Ieee.ipynb. This produces a single .csv without duplicates.
