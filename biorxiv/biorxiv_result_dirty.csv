DeepBound: Accurate Identification of Transcript Boundaries via Deep Convolutional Neural Fields,"Mingfu Shao, Jianzhu Ma, Sheng Wang",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2017,"Motivation: Reconstructing the full-length expressed transcripts (a.k.a. the transcript assembly problem) from the short sequencing reads produced by RNA-seq protocol plays a central role in identifying novel genes and transcripts as well as in studying gene expressions and gene functions. A crucial step in transcript assembly is to accurately determine the splicing junctions and boundaries of the expressed transcripts from the reads alignment. In contrast to the splicing junctions that can be efficiently detected from spliced reads, the problem of identifying boundaries remains open and challenging, due to the fact that the signal related to boundaries is noisy and weak.

Results: We present DeepBound, an effective approach to identify boundaries of expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads alignment. In its core DeepBound employs deep convolutional neural fields to learn the hidden distributions and patterns of boundaries. To accurately model the transition probabilities and to solve the label-imbalance problem, we novelly incorporate the AUC (area under the curve) score into the optimizing objective function. To address the issue that deep probabilistic graphical models requires large number of labeled training samples, we propose to use simulated RNA-seq datasets to train our model. Through extensive experimental studies on both simulation datasets of two species and biological datasets, we show that DeepBound consistently and significantly outperforms the two existing methods.

A Model Of Plasticity-Dependent Network Activity In Rodent Hippocampus During Exploration Of Novel Environments,"Panagiota Theodoni, Bernat Rovira, Alex Roxin",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as “replays”. It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are “transferred” from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the formation of attracting manifolds: patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, the attractors are formed most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of these model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivition of the medial septum we find no such increase. This is consistent with the model, which predicts orders of magnitude lower learning rates when theta is absent.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/118489,biorxiv,2017,93e19724-455b-4fc3-a9b9-c64566b19993,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/118489.full.pdf
High accuracy label-free classification of kinetic cell states from holographic cytometry,"Miroslav Hejna, Aparna Jorapur, Jun S. Song, Robert L. Judson",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Digital holographic microscopy permits live and label-free visualization of adherent cells. Here we report the application of this approach for high accuracy kinetic quantitative cytometry. We identify twenty-six label-free optical and morphological features that are biologically independent. When used as a basis for machine learning, these features allow blind single cell classification with up to 95% accuracy. We present methods to control for inherent holographic noise, thereby establishing a set of reliable quantitative features. Together, these contributions permit continuous digital holographic cytometry for three or more days. Applying our approach to human melanoma cells treated with a panel of cancer therapeutics, we can track the response of each cell, simultaneously classifying multiple behaviors such as cell cycle length, motility, apoptosis, senescence, and heterogeneity of response to each therapeutic. Importantly, we demonstrate relationships between these phenotypes over time. This work thus provides an experimental and computational roadmap for low cost live-cell imaging and kinetic classification of heterogeneous adherent cell populations.","['songj@illinois.edu', 'robert.judson@ucsf.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/14/127449,biorxiv,2017,64ef6b6b-c202-4429-a49c-ccbf47d52a37,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/14/127449.full.pdf
Generators and connectivity of the early auditory evoked gamma band response.,"Nenad Polomac, Gregor Leicht, Guido Nolte, Christina Andreou, Till R. Schneider, Saskia Steinmann, Andreas K. Engel, Christoph Mulert",Now published in Brain Topography. 2015,"Background: High frequency oscillations in the gamma range are known to be involved in early stages of auditory information processing in terms of synchronization of brain regions, e.g., in cognitive functions. It has been shown using EEG source localisation, as well as simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI, that the auditory evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) is modulated by attention. In addition to auditory cortex activity a dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) generator could be involved. In the present study we investigated aeGBR magnetic fields using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We aimed to localize the aeGBR sources and its connectivity features in relation to mental effort. 
Methods: We investigated the aeGBR magnetic fields in 13 healthy participants using a 275-channel CTF-MEG system. The experimental paradigms were two auditory choice reaction tasks with different difficulties and demands for mental effort. We performed source localization with eLORETA and calculated the aeGBR lagged phase synchronization between bilateral auditory cortices and frontal midline structures.
Results: The eLORETA analysis revealed sources of the aeGBR within bilateral auditory cortices and in frontal midline structures of the brain including the dACC. Compared to the control condition the dACC source activity was found to be significantly stronger during the performance of the cognitively demanding task. Moreover, this task involved a significantly stronger functional connectivity between auditory cortices and dACC.
Conclusion: In accordance with previous EEG and EEG-fMRI investigations, our study confirms an aeGBR generator in the dACC by means of MEG and suggests its involvement in the effortful processing of auditory stimuli.",['c.mulert@uke.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/28/014514,biorxiv,2015,bc0aacfe-1b57-4b05-8e90-8d0f242010b3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/28/014514.full.pdf

Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems -- patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients -- to predict whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem.

Frontal cortex function derives from hierarchical predictive coding,"William H Alexander, Joshua W Brown",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"The frontal lobes are essential for human volition and goal-directed behavior, yet their function remains unclear. While various models have highlighted working memory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive control as key functions, a single framework for interpreting the range of effects observed in prefrontal cortex has yet to emerge.  Here we show that a simple computational motif based on predictive coding can be stacked hierarchically to learn and perform arbitrarily complex goal-directed behavior.  The resulting Hierarchical Error Representation (HER) model simulates a wide array of findings from fMRI, ERP, single-units, and neuropsychological studies of both lateral and medial prefrontal cortex.  Additionally, the model compares favorably with current machine learning approaches, learning more rapidly and with comparable performance, while self-organizing representations into efficient hierarchical groups and managing working memory storage.  By reconceptualizing lateral prefrontal activity as anticipating prediction errors, the HER model provides a novel unifying account of prefrontal cortex function with broad implications both for understanding the frontal cortex and building more powerful machine learning applications","['william.alexander@ugent.be', 'jwmbrown@indiana.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/21/076505,biorxiv,2016,7abbcf81-d9a0-4bd9-9ff1-fb0fce7b4856,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/21/076505.full.pdf
Sub-kb resolution Hi-C in D. melanogaster reveals conserved characteristics of TADs between insect and mammalian cells,"Qi Wang, Qiu Sun, Daniel M. Czajkowsky, Zhifeng Shao",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental elements of the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome. However, while the structural importance of the insulator protein CTCF together with cohesin at TAD borders in mammalian cells is well established, the absence of such co-localization at most TAD borders in recent Hi-C studies of D. melanogaster is enigmatic, raising the possibility that these TAD border elements are not generally conserved among metazoans. Using in situ Hi-C with sub-kb resolution, we show that the genome of D. melanogaster is almost completely partitioned into more than 4,000 TADs (median size, 13 kb), nearly 7-fold more than previously identified. The overwhelming majority of these TADs are demarcated by pairs of Drosophila specific insulator proteins, BEAF-32/CP190 or BEAF-32/Chromator, indicating that these proteins may play an analogous role in Drosophila as that of the CTCF/cohesin pair in mammals. Moreover, we find that previously identified TADs enriched for inactive chromatin are predominantly assembled from the higher-level interactions between smaller TADs. In contrast, the contiguous small TADs in regions previously thought to be unstructured ""inter-TADs"" are organized in an open configuration with far fewer TAD-TAD interactions. Such structures can also be identified in some ""inter-TAD"" regions of the mammalian genome, suggesting that larger assemblages of small self-associating TADs separated by a ""burst"" of contiguous small, weakly associating TADs may be a conserved, basic characteristic of the higher order folding of the metazoan genome.","['zfshao@sjtu.edu.cn', 'dczaj@sjtu.edu.cn.']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/164467,biorxiv,2017,238cbf74-f6b8-40d2-963f-8a7c0cc5755f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/164467.full.pdf
Rehabilitation promotes the recovery of distinct functional and structural features of healthy neuronal networks after stoke,"Anna Letizia Allegra Mascaro, Emilia Conti, Stefano Lai, Antonino Paolo Di Giovanna, Cristina Spalletti, Claudia Alia, Eros Quarta, Alessandro Panarese, Leonardo Sacconi, Silvestro Micera, Matteo Caleo, Francesco S.

Despite its importance, the processes associated with rehabilitative intervention are poorly understood. One of the most challenging experimental goals is to unambiguously link specific circuit changes induced by rehabilitation in recovering animals to improved behavior. Here, we investigate which facets of cortical remodeling are induced by rehabilitative therapy after stroke by combining optical imaging and manipulation tools. We demonstrate the progressive restoration of cortical motor maps and of cortical activity in parallel with the reinforcement of inter-hemispheric connectivity after rehabilitation. Furthermore, we reveal that the increase in vascular density goes along with the stabilization of peri-infarct neural circuitry at synaptic level. The present work provides the first evidences that rehabilitation is sufficient to promote the combined recovery of distinct structural and functional features distinctive of healthy neuronal networks.

PHATE: A Dimensionality Reduction Method for Visualizing Trajectory Structures in High-Dimensional Biological Data,"Kevin R. Moon, David van Dijk, Zheng Wang, William Chen, Matthew J Hirn, Ronald R Coifman, Natalia B Ivanova, Guy Wolf, Smita Krishnaswamy",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In recent years, dimensionality reduction methods have become critical for visualization, exploration, and interpretation of high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, as they enable the extraction of major trends in the data while discarding noise. However, biological data contains a type of predominant structure that is not preserved in commonly used methods such as PCA and tSNE, namely, branching progression structure. This structure, which is often non-linear, arises from underlying biological processes such as differentiation, graded responses to stimuli, and population drift, which generate cellular (or population) diversity. We propose a novel, affinity-preserving embedding called PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding), designed explicitly to preserve progression structure in data.

PHATE provides a denoised, two or three-dimensional visualization of the complete branching trajectory structure in high-dimensional data. It uses heat-diffusion processes, which naturally denoise the data, to compute cell-cell affinities. Then, PHATE creates a diffusion-potential geometry by free-energy potentials of these processes. This geometry captures high-dimensional trajectory structures, while enabling a natural embedding of the intrinsic data geometry. This embedding accurately visualizes trajectories and data distances, without requiring strict assumptions typically used by path-finding and tree-fitting algorithms, which have recently been used for pseudotime orderings or tree-renderings of cellular data. Furthermore, PHATE supports a wide range of data exploration tasks by providing interpretable overlays on top of the visualization. We show that such overlays can emphasize and reveal trajectory end-points, branch points and associated split-decisions, progression-forming variables (e.g., specific genes), and paths between developmental events in cellular state-space. We demonstrate PHATE on single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry data pertaining to embryoid body differentiation, IPSC reprogramming, and hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. We also demonstrate PHATE on non-single cell data including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) measurements of European populations, and 16s sequencing of gut microbiota.","['smita.krishnaswamy@yale.edu', 'natalia.ivanova@yale.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/120378,biorxiv,2017,dac726b2-e05f-420a-98d1-90aeed36c98b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/120378.full.pdf
Physiological Gaussian Process Priors for the Hemodynamics in fMRI Analysis,"Josef Wilzen, Anders Eklund, Mattias Villani",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Inference from fMRI data faces the challenge that the hemodynamic system, that relates the underlying neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal, is not known. We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD time series, rather than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a flexible way. The prior mean function may be generated from a standard LTI system, based on a canonical hemodynamic response function, or a more elaborate physiological model such as the Balloon model. This gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the GP, but allows the posterior to fall back on the physiologically based prior when the data are weak. Results on simulated data show that even with an erroneous prior for the GP, the proposed model is still able to discriminate between active and non-active voxels in a satisfactory way. The proposed model is also applied to real fMRI data, where our Gaussian process model in several cases finds brain activity where a baseline model with fixed hemodynamics does not.",['josef.wilzen@liu.se'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/23/179838,biorxiv,2017,b2c5fa89-2fb1-407b-a527-b61a42fdd581,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/23/179838.full.pdf
Flexible control of speed of cortical dynamics,"Jing Wang, Devika Narain, Eghbal Hosseini, Mehrdad Jazayeri",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can control the cadence of their speech, and children can flexibly vary their temporal expectations of events. To understand the neural basis of such flexible timing, we recorded from the medial frontal cortex of primates trained to produce different time intervals with different effectors. The activity of neurons was heterogeneous, nonlinear and complex. However, responses were unified under a remarkable form of invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally stretched for longer intervals and compressed for short ones. At the network level, this phenomenon was evident by flexible changes in the speed with which the population activity traced an invariant trajectory. To identify the origin of speed control, we recorded from both downstream caudate neurons and thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex. Speed adjustments were a prominent feature in the caudate but not in the thalamus suggesting that this phenomenon originates within cortical networks. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we created recurrent neural network models at different levels of complexity that could explain flexible timing with speed control. Analysis of the models revealed that the key to flexible speed control was the action of an external input upon the nonlinearities of individual neurons whose recurrent interactions set the network relaxation dynamics. These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism for conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and cognitive functions.",['mjaz@mit.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/25/155390,biorxiv,2017,9c088d36-d771-49eb-bd43-f03b44e353bd,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/25/155390.full.pdf
Amortized Hypothesis Generation,"Ishita Dasgupta, Eric Schulz, Noah Goodman, Samuel Gershman",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Bayesian models of cognition posit that people compute probability distributions over hypotheses, possibly by constructing a sample-based approximation. Since people encounter many closely related distributions, a computationally efficient strategy is to selectively reuse computations -- either the samples themselves or some summary statistic. We refer to these reuse strategies as amortized inference. In two experiments, we present evidence consistent with amortization. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query. Using a cognitive load manipulation, we find evidence that people cache summary statistics rather than raw sample sets.

Task-Dependent Representations Of Stimulus And Choice In Mouse Parietal Cortex," View ORCID ProfileGerald Pho,  View ORCID ProfileMichael Goard, Jonathan Woodson, Benjamin Crawford, Mriganka Sur",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual decisions, but whether its role is specific to sensory processing or sensorimotor transformation is not well understood. To distinguish these possibilities, we trained mice of either sex to perform a visual discrimination task and imaged the activity of PPC populations during both engaged behavior and passive viewing. Unlike neurons in primary visual cortex (V1), which responded robustly to stimuli in both conditions, most neurons in PPC responded exclusively during task engagement. However, PPC responses were heterogeneous, with a smaller subset of neurons exhibiting stimulus-driven, contrast-dependent responses in both conditions. Neurons in PPC also exhibit stronger modulation by noise correlations relative to V1, as illustrated by a generalized linear model that takes into account both task variables and between-neuron correlations. To test whether PPC responses primarily encoded the stimulus or the learned sensorimotor contingency, we imaged the same neurons before and after re-training mice on a reversed task contingency. Unlike V1 neurons, most PPC neurons exhibited a dramatic shift in selectivity after re-training and reflected the new sensorimotor contingency, while a smaller subset of neurons preserved their stimulus selectivity. Mouse PPC is therefore strongly task-dependent, contains heterogeneous populations sensitive to stimulus and choice, and may play an important role in the flexible transformation of sensory inputs into motor commands.",['msur@mit.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/31/144592,biorxiv,2017,ac0d7a8d-8cb9-4693-bf93-3845a291cd2c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/31/144592.full.pdf
Cell Dynamics Underlying Oriented Growth Of The Drosophila Imaginal Wing Disc,"Natalie A. Dye, Marko Popovic, Stephanie Spannl, Raphael Etournay, Dagmar Kainmueller, Eugene W. Myers, Frank Julicher, Suzanne Eaton",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Quantitative analysis of the dynamic cellular mechanisms shaping the Drosophila wing during its larval growth phase has been limited, impeding our ability to understand how morphogen patterns regulate tissue shape. Such analysis requires imaging explants under conditions that maintain both growth and patterning, as well as methods to quantify how much cellular behaviors change tissue shape. Here, we demonstrate a key requirement for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the maintenance of numerous patterning systems in vivo and in explant culture. We find that low concentrations of 20E support prolonged proliferation in explanted wing discs in the absence of insulin, incidentally providing novel insight into the hormonal regulation of imaginal growth. We use 20E-containing media to directly observe growth and apply recently developed methods for quantitatively decomposing tissue shape changes into cellular contributions. We discover that while cell divisions drive tissue expansion along one axis, their contribution to expansion along the orthogonal axis is canceled by cell rearrangements and cell shape changes.

The genomic signature of social interactions regulating honey bee caste development,"Svjetlana Vojvodic, Brian R Johnson, Brock Harpur, Clement Kent, Amro Zayed, Kirk E Anderson, Timothy Linksvayer",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"Social evolution theory posits the existence of genes expressed in one individual that affect the traits and fitness of social partners. The archetypal example of reproductive altruism, honey bee reproductive caste, involves strict social regulation of larval caste fate by care-giving nurses. However, the contribution of nurse-expressed genes, which are prime socially-acting candidate genes, to the caste developmental program and to caste evolution remains mostly unknown. We experimentally induced new queen production by removing the current colony queen, and we used RNA sequencing to study the gene expression profiles of both developing larvae and their care-giving nurses before and after queen removal. By comparing the gene expression profiles between both queen-destined larvae and their nurses to worker-destined larvae and their nurses in queen-present and queen-absent conditions, we identified larval and nurse genes associated with larval caste development and with queen presence. Of 950 differentially-expressed genes associated with larval caste development, 82% were expressed in larvae and 18% were expressed in nurses. Behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that nurses may specialize in the short term feeding queen- versus worker-destined larvae. Estimated selection coefficients indicated that both nurse and larval genes associated with caste are rapidly evolving, especially those genes associated with worker development. Of the 1863 differentially-expressed genes associated with queen presence, 90% were expressed in nurses.

Additionally, it is common for the target proteins to bind indirectly to DNA via co-factors, with the result that the ChIP-seq peaks contain a mixture of motifs.  Few tools exist to deal effectively with this problem.

Results: We describe a new approach to motif finding that models the problem as one of clustering bound regions based on sequence similarity.  We take an iterative ""top-down"" approach of repeatedly subdividing an initial single large cluster of all input sequences into smaller and smaller clusters, while also exploring shift and reverse-strand matches of sequences to clusters.  Our implementation is significantly faster than any other ChIP-seq-oriented motif-finding program we tested, able to process 5,000 sequences of 100bp length in a few minutes, or 30,000 sequences in 1-2 hours, on a desktop computer using a single CPU core.  On synthetic data it outperforms all programs except one (MuMoD) on accuracy; compared to MuMoD it is somewhat less accurate but orders of magnitude faster.  It is designed to perform well with ""window"" sizes much larger than the length of a typical binding site (7-15 base pairs), and we commonly run it with window sizes of 50bp or more.  On actual genomic data it successfully recovers literature motifs, but also uncovers highly complex sequence characteristics in flanking DNA, and in many cases recovers secondary motifs (of possible, and sometimes documented, biological significance) even when they occur in less than 5% of the input sequences.  We suggest that this is a powerful new approach to the analysis of ChIP-seq data.",['rsidd@imsc.res.in'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/29/104109,biorxiv,2017,967aeb29-8c42-4b95-8339-cb4c9f5b70bd,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/29/104109.full.pdf
A large-scale circuit mechanism for hierarchical dynamical processing in the primate cortex,"Rishidev Chaudhuri, Kenneth Knoblauch, Marie-Alice Gariel, Henry Kennedy, Xiao-Jing Wang",Now published in Neuron. 2015,"We developed a large-scale dynamical model of the macaque neocortex based on recent quantitative connectivity data. A hierarchy of timescales naturally emerges from this system: sensory areas show brief, transient responses to input (appropriate for sensory processing), whereas association areas integrate inputs over time and exhibit persistent activity (suitable for decision-making and working memory). The model displays multiple temporal hierarchies, as evidenced by contrasting responses to visual and somatosensory stimulation. Moreover, slower prefrontal and temporal areas have a disproportionate impact on global brain dynamics. These findings establish for the first time a circuit mechanism for ""temporal receptive windows"" that are progressively enlarged along the cortical hierarchy, extend the concept of working memory from local to large circuits, and suggest a re-interpretation of functional connectivity measures.",['xjwang@nyu.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/26/017137,biorxiv,2015,b58afea1-0b71-4522-b71f-cebb2ea89585,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/26/017137.full.pdf

Here we introduce Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) for the analysis of mass cytometry datasets. HSNE constructs a hierarchy of non-linear similarities that can be interactively explored with a stepwise increase in detail up to the single-cell level. We applied HSNE to a study on gastrointestinal disorders and three other available mass cytometry datasets. We found that HSNE efficiently replicates previous observations and identifies rare cell populations that were previously missed due to downsampling. Thus, HSNE removes the scalability limit of conventional t-SNE analysis, a feature that makes it highly suitable for the analysis of massive high-dimensional datasets.","['B.P.F.Lelieveldt@lumc.nl', 'V.van_unen@lumc.nl']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/13/169888,biorxiv,2017,207697e3-7721-4058-85db-e5ee8bbfe503,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/13/169888.full.pdf

In line with the gene balance hypothesis, we find preferential retention of expressed flowering time genes relative to the whole genome. Furthermore, gene expression dynamics across development reveal diverged regulation of many flowering time gene copies. This finding supports the concept of responsive backup circuits being key for the retention of duplicated genes.

A new multi-genomic approach for the study of biogeochemical cycles at global scale: the molecular reconstruction of the sulfur cycle,"Valerie De Anda, Icoquih Zapata-Penasco, Bruno Contreras-Moreira, Augusto Cesar Poot-Hernandez, Luis E. Eguiarte, Valeria Souza",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Despite the great advances in microbial ecology and the explosion of high throughput sequencing, our ability to understand and integrate the global biogeochemical cycles is still limited.

This methodology produces a single value, called the Sulfur Score (SS), which informs about the specific S-related molecular machinery. After curating an inventory of microorganisms, pathways and genes taking part in this cycle, we benchmark the performance of the SS on a collection of 2,107 non-redundant RefSeq genomes, 900 metagenomes from MG-RAST and 35 metagenomes analyzed for the first time. We find that the SS is able to correctly classify microorganisms known to be involved in the S-cycle, yielding an Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.985. Moreover, when sorting environments the top-scoring metagenomes were hydrothermal vents, microbial mats and deep-sea sediments, among others. This methodology can be generalized to the analysis of other biogeochemical cycles or processes.

Disruption of perineuronal nets increases the frequency of sharp wave ripples,"ZhiYong Sun, P. Lorenzo Bozzelli, Adam Caccavano, Megan Allen, Jason Balmuth, Stefano Vicini, Jian-Young Wu, Katherine Conant",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) represent irregularly occurring synchronous neuronal population events that are observed during phases of rest and slow wave sleep. SWR activity that follows learning involves sequential replay of training-associated neuronal assemblies and is critical for systems level memory consolidation. SWRs are initiated by CA2 or CA3 pyramidal cells and require initial excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as subsequent participation of parvalbumin (PV) expressing fast spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons are relatively unique in that they represent the major neuronal cell type known to be surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), lattice like structures composed of a hyaluronin backbone that surround the cell soma and proximal dendrites. Though the function of the PNN is not completely understood, previous studies suggest it may serve to localize glutamatergic input to synaptic contacts and thus influence the activity of ensheathed cells. Noting that FS PV interneurons impact the activity of pyramidal cells thought to initiate SWRs, and that their activity is critical to ripple expression, we examine the effects of PNN integrity on SWR activity in the hippocampus.  Extracellular recordings from the stratum radiatum of 490 micron horizontal murine hippocampal hemisections demonstrate SWRs that occur spontaneously in CA1. As compared to vehicle, pretreatment (120 min) of paired hemislices with hyaluronidase, which cleaves the hyaluronin backbone of the PNN, decreases PNN integrity and increases SWR frequency. Pretreatment with chondroitinase, which cleaves PNN side chains, also increases SWR frequency. Together, these data contribute to an emerging appreciation of extracellular matrix as a regulator of neuronal plasticity and suggest that one function of mature perineuronal nets could be to modulate the frequency of SWR events.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/124677,biorxiv,2017,f6c19cb5-03c0-49f7-bd16-bae95026349b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/124677.full.pdf
Nano Random Forests to mine protein complexes and their relationships in quantitative proteomics data," View ORCID ProfileLuis F Montano-Gutierrez, Shinya Ohta, Georg Kustatscher, William C Earnshaw,  View ORCID ProfileJuri Rappsilber",Now published in Molecular Biology of the Cell. 2016,"The large and ever-increasing numbers of quantitative proteomics datasets constitute a currently underexploited resource for drawing biological insights on proteins and their functions. Multiple observations by different laboratories indicate that protein complexes often follow consistent trends. However, proteomic data is often noisy and incomplete − members of a complex may correlate only in a fraction of all experiments, or may not be observed in all experiments. Inclusion of potentially uninformative data hence imposes the risk of weakening biological signals.  We have previously used the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm to distinguish functional chromosomal proteins from hitchhikers in an analysis of mitotic chromosomes. Even though it is assumed that RFs need large training sets, in this technical note we show that RFs also are able to detect small protein complexes and relationships between them. We use artificial datasets to demonstrate the robustness of RFs to identify small groups even when working with mixes of noisy and apparently uninformative experiments. We then use our procedure to retrieve a number of chromosomal complexes from real quantitative proteomics results, which compare wild-type and multiple different knock-out mitotic chromosomes. The procedure also revealed other proteins that covary strongly with these complexes suggesting novel functional links. Integrating the RF analysis for several complexes revealed the known interdependency of kinetochore subcomplexes, as well as an unexpected dependency between the Constitutive-Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and the condensin (SMC 2/4) complex. Serving as negative control, ribosomal proteins remained independent of kinetochore complexes.

Rats were trained on a plus maze in either a spatial navigation or a cue response task (individual training), while a third set of rats acquired both (concurrent training). Subsequently, the rats underwent either sham surgery or neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (HPC), medial dorsal striatum (DSM) or lateral dorsal striatum (DSL), followed by retention testing. Finally, rats in the individual training condition also acquired the novel 'other' task. When rats learned one task, HPC and DSL selectively supported spatial navigation cue response, respectively. However, when rats learned both tasks, HPC and DSL additionally supported the behavior incongruent with the processing style of the corresponding memory system. DSM significantly contributed to performance regardless of task or training procedure. Experience with the cue response task facilitated subsequent spatial learning, while experience with spatial navigation delayed both simultaneous and subsequent response learning.

Way,  View ORCID ProfileGeorgia Doing,  View ORCID ProfileDeborah A. Hogan,  View ORCID ProfileCasey S. Greene",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: Investigators often interpret genome-wide data by analyzing the expression levels of genes within pathways. While this within-pathway analysis is routine, the products of any one pathway can affect the activity of other pathways. Past efforts to identify relationships between biological processes have evaluated overlap in knowledge bases or evaluated changes that occur after specific treatments. Individual experiments can highlight condition-specific pathway-pathway relationships; however, constructing a complete network of such relationships across many conditions requires analyzing results from many studies.  Results: We developed the PathCORE software to identify global pathway-pathway relationships, i.e. those evident across a broad data compendium. PathCORE starts with the results of robust feature construction algorithms, which are now being developed and applied to transcriptomic data. PathCORE identifies pathways grouped together in features more than expected by chance as functionally co-occurring. We performed example analyses using PathCORE for a microbial compendium for which eADAGE features were already available and a TCGA dataset of 33 cancer types that we analyzed via NMF. PathCORE recapitulated previously described pathway-pathway relationships and suggested additional relationships with biological plausibility that remain to be explored. The software also identifies genes associated with each relationship and includes demonstration source code for a web interface that users can modify to (1) visualize the network produced by applying the PathCORE software to their specific inputs and (2) review the expression levels of associated genes in the original data. The web interface can help biologists design experiments to test the relationships that were identified using PathCORE.  Conclusions: PathCORE is a hypothesis generation tool that identifies co-occurring pathways from the results of unsupervised analysis of the growing body of gene expression data and visualizes the relationships between pathways as a network.

Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimer′s disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features.

Our main results are the following: the B-cell repertoire is substantially more diverse than T-cell repertoires, due to longer junctional insertions; sequences that pass initial selection are distinguished by having a higher probability of being generated in a VDJ recombination event; somatic hypermutations have a non-uniform distribution along the V gene that is well explained by an independent site model for the sequence context around the hypermutation site.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/11/015115,biorxiv,2015,c38c476b-b30d-4080-a0c2-b42a8996aef0,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/11/015115.full.pdf
Determination of Ubiquitin Fitness Landscapes Under Different Chemical Stresses in a Classroom Setting,"David Mavor, Participants in UCSF PUBS Class, James Fraser",Now published in eLife. 2015,"Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational regulatory process that can control protein stability, localization, and activity. Ubiquitin is essential for eukaryotic life and is highly conserved, varying in only 3 amino acid positions between yeast and humans. However, recent deep sequencing studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single amino acid mutations. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that the set of tolerated substitutions would be reduced when the cultures are not grown in rich media conditions and that chemically induced physiologic perturbations might unmask constraints on the ubiquitin sequence. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed a deep mutational scanning procedure to determine the fitness landscape of a library of all possible single amino acid mutations of ubiquitin in the presence of one of five small molecule perturbations: MG132, Dithiothreitol (DTT), Hydroxyurea (HU), Caffeine, and DMSO. Our data reveal that the number of tolerated substitutions is greatly reduced by DTT, HU, or Caffeine, and that these perturbations uncover “shared sensitized positions” localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and to the C-terminus. We also show perturbation specific effects including the sensitization of His68 in HU and tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Taken together, our data suggest that chemical stress reduces buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system, revealing previously hidden fitness defects. By expanding the set of chemical perturbations assayed, potentially by other classroom-based experiences, we will be able to further address the apparent dichotomy between the extreme sequence conservation and the experimentally observed mutational tolerance of ubiquitin. Finally, this study demonstrates the realized potential of a project lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum.",['james.fraser@ucsf.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/25/025452,biorxiv,2015,6665b6d0-e710-47db-8180-2c5b9df2b1d3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/25/025452.full.pdf
Homeostasis of columnar synchronization during cortical map formation," View ORCID ProfileMatthew T Colonnese, Jing Shen",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Synchronous spontaneous activity is critical for circuit development. A key open question is to what degree is this synchronization models adult activity or is specifically tuned for circuit development.  To address this we used multi-electrode array recordings of spontaneous activity in non-anesthetized neonatal mice to quantify firing rates, synchronization, binary spike-vectors and population-coupling of single-units throughout the period of map formation. Consistent with the first hypothesis, adult-like network interactions are established during the period of retinal waves, before the onset of vision and normal inhibition, and are largely conserved throughout juvenile ages.  Significant differences from mature properties were limited to initial topographic map formation, when synchronization was lower than expected by chance, suggesting active decoupling in early networks. These findings suggest that developmental activity models adult synchronization, and that there is remarkable homeostasis of network properties throughout development, despite massive changes in the drive and circuit basis of cortical activity.",['colonnese@gwu.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/15/075341,biorxiv,2016,0e195dae-a055-4d4c-9341-3b76c9f23e41,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/15/075341.full.pdf
A simple model-based approach to inferring and visualizing cancer mutation signatures,"Yuichi Shiraishi, Georg Tremmel, Satoru Miyano, Matthew Stephens",Now published in PLoS Genetics. 2015,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled
the production of
massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or ``mutation signatures'' at an unprecedented resolution, with the
potential for new insights into
the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis.

Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods
greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. 

We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a
larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types.
The results illustrate several important features
of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization
tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature,
the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site.

The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely
connected with ``mixed-membership models'' which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve
understanding of mutation signature extraction problems,
and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.

Euplotid: A Linux-based platform to physically edit the genome,Diego Borges-Rivera,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Euplotid is composed of a set of constantly evolving bioinformatic pipelines encapsulated and running in Docker containers enabling a user to build and annotate the local regulatory structure of every gene starting from raw sequencing reads of DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory neighborhood of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are then mapped to Transcription Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Convolutional Neural Networks are combined with Long-Short Term Memory in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, one neural network for each protein in the genome is trained on all available Chip-Seq and SELEX data, learning what pattern of DNA oligonucleotides the factor binds. The neural networks are then merged and trained on chromatin accessibility data, building a rationally designed neural network architecture capable of predicting chromatin accessibility. Transcription factor binding and identity at each peak is annotated using this trained neural network architecture. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any human transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D and 3D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge, such as GWAS results.

Light sheet microscopy for everyone? Experience of building an OpenSPIM to study flatworm development,"Johannes Girstmair, Anne Zakrzewski, François Lapraz, Mette Handberg-Thorsager, Pavel Tomancak, Peter Gabriel Pitrone, Fraser Simpson, Maximilian J Telford",Now published in BMC Developmental Biology. 2016,"BACKGROUND: Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM a type of light sheet microscopy) involves focusing a thin sheet of laser light through a specimen at right angles to the objective lens.  As only the thin section of the specimen at the focal plane of the lens is illuminated, out of focus light is naturally absent and toxicity due to light (phototoxicity) is greatly reduced enabling longer term live imaging.  OpenSPIM is an open access platform (Pitrone et al. 2013 and OpenSPIM.org) created to give new users step by step instructions on building a basic configuration of a SPIM microscope, which can in principle be adapted and upgraded to each laboratorys own requirements and budget. Here we describe our own experience with the process of designing, building, configuring and using an OpenSPIM for our research into the early development of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri, a non model animal. 
RESULTS: Our OpenSPIM builds on the standard design with the addition of two colour laser illumination for simultaneous detection of two probes/molecules and dual sided illumination, which provides more even signal intensity across a specimen. Our OpenSPIM provides high resolution 3d images and time lapse recordings, and we demonstrate the use of two colour lasers and the benefits of two color dual-sided imaging.  We used our microscope to study the development of the embryo of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri.  The capabilities of our microscope are demonstrated by our ability to record the stereotypical spiral cleavage pattern of Maritigrella with high speed multi view time lapse imaging. 3D and 4D (3D and time) reconstruction of early development from these data is possible using image registration and deconvolution tools provided as part of the open source Fiji platform. We discuss our findings on the pros and cons of a self built microscope.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that home built microscopes, such as an OpenSPIM, together with the available open source software, such as MicroManager and Fiji, make SPIM accessible to anyone interested in having continuous access to their own light-sheet microscope. However, building an OpenSPIM is not without challenges and an open access microscope is a worthwhile, if significant, investment of time and money. Multi view 4D microscopy is more challenging than we had expected. We hope that our gained experience during this project will help future OpenSPIM users with similar ambitions.",['m.telford@ucl.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/23/045187,biorxiv,2016,9ab06960-c6d4-408c-87fe-638e2edb73e3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/23/045187.full.pdf

One strategy for reaching a tractable understanding of circuit function is to seek the simplest dynamical system that can account for the population activity.

Evoking locomotion moved the population into a low-dimensional, periodic, decaying orbit - a spiral - in which it behaved as a true attractor, converging to the same orbit when evoked, and returning to that orbit after transient perturbation. We found the same attractor in every preparation, and could predict motor output directly from its orbit, yet individual neurons' participation changed across consecutive locomotion bouts. From these results, we propose that only the low-dimensional dynamics for movement control, and not the high-dimensional population activity, are consistent within and between nervous systems.","['william.frost@rosalindfranklin.edu', 'mark.humphries@manchester.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/07/104562,biorxiv,2017,1da28e19-4617-40c3-b8c4-7f48ff32b610,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/07/104562.full.pdf

Determining controllability of sepsis using genetic algorithms on a proxy agent-based model of systemic inflammation,"Chase Cockrell, Gary An",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Sepsis, a manifestation of the body's inflammatory response to injury and infection, has a mortality rate of between 28%-50% and affects approximately 1 million patients annually in the United States. Currently, there are no therapies targeting the cellular/molecular processes driving sepsis that have demonstrated the ability to control this disease process in the clinical setting. We propose that this is in great part due to the considerable heterogeneity of the clinical trajectories that constitute clinical “sepsis,” and that determining how this system can be controlled back into a state of health requires the application of concepts drawn from the field of dynamical systems. In this work, we consider the human immune system to be a random dynamical system, and investigate its potential controllability using an agent-based model of the innate immune response (the Innate Immune Response ABM or IIRABM) as a surrogate, proxy system. Simulation experiments with the IIRABM provide an explanation as to why single/limited cytokine perturbations at a single, or small number of, time points is unlikely to significantly improve the mortality rate of sepsis.  We then use genetic algorithms (GA) to explore and characterize multi-targeted control strategies for the random dynamical immune system that guide it from a persistent, non-recovering inflammatory state (functionally equivalent to the clinical states of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis) to a state of health. We train the GA on a single parameter set with multiple stochastic replicates, and show that while the calculated results show good generalizability, more advanced strategies are needed to achieve the goal of adaptive personalized medicine.

Although comparative studies of brain size have been criticized for not reflecting how evolution actually operates, and for producing spurious, inconsistent results, the causes of these limitations have received little discussion. We show how these issues arise from implicit assumptions about what brain size measures and how it correlates with behavioral and cognitive traits. We explore how inconsistencies can arise through heterogeneity in evolutionary trajectories and selection pressures on neuroanatomy or neurophysiology across taxa. We examine how interference from ecological and life history variables complicates interpretations of brain-behavior correlations, and point out how this problem is exacerbated by the limitations of brain and cognitive measures. These considerations, and the diversity of brain morphologies and behavioral capacities, suggest that comparative brain-behavior research can make greater progress by focusing on specific neuroanatomical and behavioral traits within relevant ecological and evolutionary contexts. We suggest that a synergistic combination of the bottom up approach of classical neuroethology and the top down approach of comparative biology/psychology within closely related but behaviorally diverse clades can limit the effects of heterogeneity, interference, and noise.

To further assess the functionality of ITRs, we first built machine learning classifiers using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model that can accurately distinguish functional sequences (phenotype genes) and nonfunctional ones (pseudogenes and unexpressed intergenic regions) by integrating 93 biochemical, evolutionary, and sequence-structure features.

However, most algorithms for constructing co-expression networks were developed in the microarray era, before high-throughput sequencing--with its unique statistical properties--became the norm for expression measurement. Here we develop Bayesian Relevance Networks, an algorithm that uses Bayesian reasoning about expression levels to account for the differing levels of uncertainty in expression measurements between highly- and lowly-expressed entities, and between samples with different sequencing depths. It combines data from groups of samples (e.g., replicates) to estimate group expression levels and confidence ranges.

Kilosort: realtime spike-sorting for extracellular electrophysiology with hundreds of channels,"Marius Pachitariu, Nicholas Steinmetz, Shabnam Kadir, Matteo Carandini, Kenneth D Harris",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime.

Honey bees further evolved a symbolic communication to direct nest mates to attractive food sources. Till now it is unclear how these capabilities evolved. Sixty years ago, Vincent Dethier demonstrated that a small-scale sugar-elicited search behavior identified in flies shows remarkable similarities with honey bee dance behavior. Those findings suggested that both behaviors are based on common mechanisms and are likely evolutionary related. We now present for the first time a detailed comparison of the sugar-elicited search behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. In both species, intake of sugar elicits a complex of searching responses. The most obvious response was an increase in turning frequency, but more importantly we found that flies and honey bees returned to the location of the sugar drop. They even returned to the food location when we prevented them from using visual and chemosensory cues indicating that this small scale local search involves path integration mechanisms. Finally, we show that visual landmarks presented in the vicinity of the sugar drop affected the search trajectory and in honey bees the sugar intake induced learning of landmarks. Together, our experiments indicate that the sugar-elicited local search exhibits two major behavioral capabilities of large-scale navigation, path integration and landmark orientation.","['axel@ncbs.res.in', 'axel.ncbs@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/171215,biorxiv,2017,55b9b6c7-0289-4cce-997d-6f0af5f7b2ab,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/171215.full.pdf

Drosophila embryogenesis scales uniformly across temperature and developmentally diverse species," View ORCID ProfileSteven Gregory Kuntz, Michael B Eisen",Now published in PLOS Genetics. 2013,"Temperature affects both the timing and outcome of animal development, but the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5°C and 32.5°C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes 33 hours at 17.5°C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5°C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5°C and have drastically slowed development by 30°C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30°C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5°C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all of the species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection in response to the thermal environment in which each species lives.",['sgkuntz@berkeley.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/11/11/000307,biorxiv,2013,eea67563-e9b0-47bc-9429-faee4c4fb73f,0,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/11/11/000307.full.pdf
Pangenome-wide and molecular evolution analyses of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa species,"Jeanneth Mosquera-Rendon, Ana M. Rada-Bravo, Sonia Cardenas-Brito, Mauricio Corredor, Eliana Restrepo-Pineda, Alfonso Benitez-Paez",Now published in BMC Genomics. 2016,"Background. Drug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains. Results. The P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing  assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Conclusions. We report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains.","['abenitez@cidbio.org.', 'abenitez@iata.csic.es.', 'jmosquera@cidbio.org', 'ana.rada@colmayor.edu.co', 'scardenas@cidbio.org', 'mauricio.corredor@udea.edu.co', 'elianarestrepo.pineda@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/11/020305,biorxiv,2016,ba3c03d4-9d78-47ef-9230-ecc50ee9af4f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/11/020305.full.pdf

RNA-protein binding motifs mining with a new hybrid deep learning based cross-domain knowledge integration approach,"Xiaoyong Pan, Hong-Bin Shen",Now published in BMC Bioinformatics. 2016,"RNA plays important roles in cells through the interactions with proteins known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and their binding motifs can provide crucial understanding of the post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs. How the RBPs correctly recognize the target RNA and why they bind specific positions is still far from clear. Artificial intelligence-based computational algorithms are widely acknowledged to be capable of speeding up this process. Although many automatic tools have been developed to predict the RNA-protein binding sites from the rapidly growing multi-resource data, e.g. from sequence, structure data etc, their different domain specific features and formats have posed significant computational challenges. One of current most difficulties is the cross-source shared common knowledge is usually at a higher abstraction level beyond the observed data, resulting in a low efficiency of direct integration of observed data in different domains. The other difficulty is how to interpret the prediction results. Existing approaches tend to terminate after outputting the potential discrete binding sites on the sequence, but how to assemble them into the meaningful binding motifs is a topic worth of further investigation. In viewing of these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based framework (iDeep) by using a novel hybrid convolutional neural network and deep belief network to predict the RBP interaction sites and motifs on RNAs. This new protocol is featured by transforming the original observed data into a high-level abstraction feature space using multiple layers of learning blocks, where the shared representations across different domains are integrated. This bottom to up abstraction strategy is also very helpful to remove the noise effects in the observed data. To validate our iDeep method, we performed experiments on 31 large-scale CLIP-seq datasets, and our results show that by integrating multiple sources of data, the average AUC can be improved by 8% compared to the best single-source-based predictor; and through cross-domain knowledge integration at an abstraction level, it outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors by 6%. Besides the overall enhanced prediction performance, the convolutional neural network module embedded in iDeep is also able to automatically capture the interpretable RNA sequential binding motifs for RBPs. Large-scale experiments show that these mined binding motifs agree well with the experimentally verified results, suggesting iDeep is a promising approach in the real-world applications.

A performance-optimized model of neural responses across the ventral visual stream,"Darren Seibert, Daniel L Yamins, Diego Ardila, Ha Hong, James J DiCarlo, Justin L Gardner",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Human visual object recognition is subserved by a multitude of cortical areas. To make sense of this system, one line of research focused on response properties of primary visual cortex neurons and developed theoretical models of a set of canonical computations such as convolution, thresholding, exponentiating and normalization that could be hierarchically repeated to give rise to more complex representations. Another line or research focused on response properties of high-level visual cortex and linked these to semantic categories useful for object recognition. Here, we hypothesized that the panoply of visual representations in the human ventral stream may be understood as emergent properties of a system constrained both by simple canonical computations and by top-level, object recognition functionality in a single unified framework (Yamins et al., 2014; Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014; Guclu and van Gerven, 2015). We built a deep convolutional neural network model optimized for object recognition and compared representations at various model levels using representational similarity analysis to human functional imaging responses elicited from viewing hundreds of image stimuli. Neural network layers developed representations that corresponded in a hierarchical consistent fashion to visual areas from V1 to LOC. This correspondence increased with optimization of the model's recognition performance. These findings support a unified view of the ventral stream in which representations from the earliest to the latest stages can be understood as being built from basic computations inspired by modeling of early visual cortex shaped by optimization for high-level object-based performance constraints.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/12/036475,biorxiv,2016,cc66ea05-8545-4e65-8a58-f3073343e4ae,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/12/036475.full.pdf
"Receptor Uptake Arrays For Vitamin B12, Siderophores And Glycans Shape Bacterial Communities",Steven A. Frank,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Molecular variants of vitamin B12, siderophores and glycans occur. To take up variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution. Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates, whereas species such as B. thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to control the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence. Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify environmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in cellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence.

Our approach confirmed most of previously described gene-phenotype associations while maintaining < 5% false positive rate, suggesting that CRISPRi screen is both sensitive and specific. Our data also supported the ability of this method to narrow down the candidate gene pool when studying operons, a unique structure in prokaryotic genome. Meanwhile, assessment of multiple loci across treatments enables us to extract several guidelines for sgRNA design for such pooled functional genomics screen. For instance, sgRNAs locating at the first 5% upstream region within ORF exhibit enhanced activity and 10 sgRNAs per gene is suggested to be enough for robust identification of gene-phenotype associations. We also optimized the hit-gene calling algorithm to identify target genes more robustly with even fewer sgRNAs.

"Chromatin environment, transcriptional regulation, and splicing distinguish lincRNAs and mRNAs","Marta Mele, Kaia Mattioli, William Mallard, David M Shechner, Chiara Gerhardinger, John Rinn",Now published in Genome Research. 2016,"While long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and mRNAs share similar biogenesis pathways, these transcript classes differ in many regards. LincRNAs are less evolutionarily conserved, less abundant, and more tissue-specific, suggesting that their pre- and post-transcriptional regulation is different from that of mRNAs.
Here, we perform an in-depth characterization of the features that contribute to lincRNA regulation in multiple human cell lines. We find that lincRNA promoters are depleted of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet enriched for some specific factors such as GATA and FOS relative to mRNA promoters. Surprisingly, we find that H3K9me3, a histone modification typically associated with transcriptional repression, is more enriched at the promoters of active lincRNA loci than at those of active mRNAs. Moreover, H3K9me3-marked lincRNA genes are more tissue-specific. The most discriminant differences between lincRNAs and mRNAs involve splicing. LincRNAs are less efficiently spliced, which cannot be explained by differences in U1 binding or the density of exonic splicing enhancers, but may be partially attributed to lower U2AF65 binding and weaker splicing-related motifs. Conversely, the stability of lincRNAs and mRNAs is similar, differing only with regard to the location of stabilizing protein binding sites. Finally, we find that certain transcriptional properties are correlated with higher evolutionary conservation in both DNA and RNA motifs, and are enriched in lincRNAs that have been functionally characterized.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/17/088484,biorxiv,2016,f9a9a582-79fd-4de6-a304-6eae8a8bfbba,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/17/088484.full.pdf

However, the impact of different modes of subsistence on recent changes in population size, patterns of gene flow, and deleterious mutational load remains to be fully characterized. We addressed this question, by generating 300 high-coverage exome sequences from various populations of rainforest hunter-gatherers and neighboring farmers from the western and eastern parts of the central African equatorial rainforest. We show here, by model-based demographic inference, that the effective population size of African populations remained fairly constant until recent millennia, during which the populations of rainforest hunter-gatherers have experienced a ~75% collapse and those of farmers a mild expansion, accompanied by a marked increase in gene flow between them. Despite these contrasting demographic patterns, African populations display limited differences in the estimated distribution of fitness effects of new nonsynonymous mutations, consistent with purifying selection against deleterious alleles of similar efficiency in the different populations. This situation contrasts with that we detect in Europeans, which are subject to weaker purifying selection than African populations. Furthermore, the per-individual mutation load of rainforest hunter-gatherers was found to be similar to that of farmers, under both additive and recessive modes of inheritance.

Revelation of the Genetic Basis for Convergent Innovative Anal Fin Pigmentation Patterns in Cichlid Fishes," View ORCID ProfileLangyu Gu, Chao Zhang, Canwei Xia",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Answer to the question whether convergent novelties share a common genetic basis is vital to understand to what extent that evolution is predictable. Convergent evolution of innovative anal fin pigmentation patterns in cichlid fishes is an ideal model for studying this question. Here, we focused on two patterns: 1) egg-spots, the circular pigmentation pattern in haplochromine lineage with different numbers, sizes and positions; 2) the blotch, with irregular boundary that is independently evolved in the ectodine lineage with limited variation. Based on a thorough comparative transcriptomic and genomic analysis, we found a common genetic basis (i.e. genes related to pigment cells, signaling pathways and metabolic pathways) with accelerated evolutionary rates between the blotch and egg-spots, suggesting that convergent evolution is in parallel with gene expression level, at least for the common genetic basis. In addition, connections of common genes to transcription factors and integration of advantageous genes with accelerated evolutionary rates related to signalling pathways were found for egg-spots gene network. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that re-use of the common genetic basis indicates their important conservative functions (eg. toolkit genes) for the origin of these convergent novel phenotypes, whereas independently evolved connections of common genes to transcription factors and the integration of advantageous genes are important for the emergence and higher evolvability of egg-spots, which is crucial to make it as a key innovation for the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes.

For example, a place cell is highly selective to location, but typically invariant to head direction. Here, we propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns -- in both their selectivity and their invariance -- are a consequence of the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of different input statistics along different spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents.

Revealing unobserved factors underlying cortical activity using a rectified latent variable model applied to neural population recordings,"Matthew R Whiteway, Daniel A Butts",Now published in Journal of Neurophysiology. 2016,"The activity of sensory cortical neurons is not only driven by external stimuli, but is also shaped by other sources of input to the cortex. Unlike external stimuli these other sources of input are challenging to experimentally control or even observe, and as a result contribute to variability of neuronal responses to sensory stimuli. However, such sources of input are likely not “noise”, and likely play an integral role in sensory cortex function. Here, we introduce the rectified latent variable model (RLVM) in order to identify these sources of input using simultaneously recorded cortical neuron populations. The RLVM is novel in that it employs non-negative (rectified) latent variables, and is able to be much less restrictive in the mathematical constraints on solutions due to the use an autoencoder neural network to initialize model parameters. We show the RLVM outperforms principal component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis across a variety of measures using simulated data. We then apply this model to the 2-photon imaging of hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex during a tactile discrimination task. Across many experiments, the RLVM identifies latent variables related to both the tactile stimulation as well as non-stimulus aspects of the behavioral task, with a majority of activity explained by the latter.

We find that only two haplotypes exist in the distal and proximal blocks of at least 7.7 Mb on chromosome Y in pigs across European and Asian continents. And the times of most recent common ancestors (TMRCA) within both haplotypes, approximately 0.14 and 0.10 million years, are far smaller than their divergence time of around 1.07 million years.

And surprisingly, European pigs share the same haplotype with many Chinese pigs, which is not consistent with their deep splitting status on autosome and mtDNA. Further analyses show that the haplotype in Chinese pigs was likely introduced from European wild boars via ancient gene flow before pig domestication about 24k years ago. Low mutation rates and no recombination in the distal and proximal blocks on chromosome Y help us detect this male-driven ancient gene flow.

Efficient Maximum-Likelihood Inference For The Isolation-With-Initial-Migration Model With Potentially Asymmetric Gene Flow,"Rui J. Costa, Hilde Wilkinson-Herbots",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"The isolation-with-migration (IM) model is commonly used to make inferences about gene flow during speciation, using polymorphism data. However, Becquet and Przeworski (2009) report that the parameter estimates obtained by fitting the IM model are very sensitive to the model's assumptions (including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present). This paper is concerned with the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model of Wilkinson-Herbots (2012), which drops precisely this assumption. In the IIM model, one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations, between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period of isolation. We derive a very fast method of fitting an extended version of the IIM model, which also allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal population sizes. This is a maximum-likelihood method, applicable to data on the number of segregating sites between pairs of DNA sequences from a large number of independent loci. In addition to obtaining parameter estimates, our method can also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different evolutionary scenarios, by means of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the procedure on pairs of Drosophila sequences from approximately 30,000 loci.

Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and increasing the expressive power of similarity score.

LMethyR-SVM: Predict human enhancers using low methylated regions based on weighted support vector machines,"Yang Dai, Jingting Xu, Hong Hu",Now published in PLOS ONE. 2016,"Abstract

Background: 
The identification of enhancer is a challenging task. Various types of epigenetic information including histone modification have been utilized in the construction of enhancer prediction models based on a diverse panel of machine learning models. However, DNA   methylation profiles generated from the whole genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS) have not been fully explored for their potential in enhancer prediction despite the fact that low methylated regions (LMRs) have been implied to be distal active regulatory regions.

Method: 
In this work we propose a prediction framework, LMethyR-SVM, using LMRs identified from cell-type-specific WGBS DNA methylation profiles based on an unlabeled-negative learning framework. In LMethyR-SVM, the set of cell-type-specific LMRs is further divided into three sets:  reliable positive, like positive, and likely negative, according to their resemblance to a small set of experimentally validated enhancers in the VISTA database based on an estimated non-parametric density distribution. Then, the prediction model is trained by solving a weighted support vector machine.

Results:
We demonstrate the performance of LMethyR-SVM by using the WGBS DNA methylation profiles derived from the H1 human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and the fetal lung fibroblast cell type (IMR90). The predicted enhancers are highly conserved with a reasonable validation rate based on a set of commonly used positive markers including transcription factors, p300 binding and DNase-I hypersensitive sites. In addition, we show evidence that the large fraction of LMethyR-SVM predicted enhancers are not predicted by ChromHMM in H1 cell type and they are more enriched for the FANTOM5 enhancers. 

Conclusion: 
Our work suggests that low methylated regions detected from the WGBS data are useful as complementary resources to histone modification marks in developing models for the prediction of cell type-specific enhancers.","['yangdai@uic.edu', 'yangdai@uic.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/19/054221,biorxiv,2016,d440ecc0-ad97-40c3-9625-c0d72b4a4945,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/19/054221.full.pdf
Longitudinal development of hippocampal subregions from childhood to adulthood,"Christian K. Tamnes, Marieke G. N. Bos, Ferdi C. van de Kamp, Sabine Peters, Eveline A.

The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with a well characterized internal complexity, but development of its distinct subregions in humans has remained poorly described. Here, we analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large longitudinal sample (270 participants, 678 scans) using a novel state-of-the-art automated segmentation tool and mixed models to delineate the development of hippocampal subregion volumes from childhood to adulthood. We also investigated whether subregion volumes and development were sexually dimorphic and related to general cognitive ability. Nonlinear developmental trajectories with early volume increases were observed for subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1, molecular layer (ML) and fimbria. In contrast, parasubiculum, presubiculum, CA2/3, CA4 and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) showed linear volume decreases. Sex differences were found for most subregion volumes, but not for their development. Finally, general cognitive ability was positively associated with CA2/3 and CA4 volumes, as well as with ML development.

One such example is the recognition of self and nonself cells by the immune system.

With this aim, we have focused on how the dyslexic brain fails to process speech sounds and reading cues. We have adopted an oscillatory perspective, according to which dyslexia results from a deficient integration of different brain rhythms during reading/spellings tasks.

The Mouse Genomes Project is an ongoing collaborative effort to sequence the genomes of the common laboratory mouse strains. In 2011, the initial analysis of sequence variation across 17 strains found 56.7M unique SNPs and 8.8M indels. We carry out deep sequencing of 13 additional inbred strains (BUB/BnJ, C57BL/10J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, DBA/1J, I/LnJ, KK/HiJ, MOLF/EiJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, RF/J, SEA/GnJ and ST/bJ), cataloging molecular variation within and across the strains. These strains include important models for immune response, leukemia, age-related hearing loss and rheumatoid arthritis. We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes.

Results
Approximately, 27.4M unique SNPs and 5M indels are identified across these strains compared to the C57BL/6J reference genome (GRCm38). The amount of variation found in the inbred laboratory mouse genome has increased to 71M SNPs and 12M indels. We investigate the genetic basis of highly penetrant cancer susceptibility in RF/J finding private novel missense mutations in DNA damage repair and highly cancer associated genes. We use two highly related strains (DBA/1J and DBA/2J) to investigate the genetic basis of collagen induced arthritis susceptibility.

Conclusion 
This paper significantly expands the catalog of fully sequenced laboratory mouse strains and now contains several examples of highly genetically similar strains with divergent phenotypes. We show how studying private missense mutations can lead to insights into the genetic mechanism for a highly penetrant phenotype.","['jf@well.ox.ac.uk', 'ad19@sanger.ac.uk', 'kw10@sanger.ac.uk', 'da1@sanger.ac.uk', 'hunterk@mail.nih.gov', 'tk2@sanger.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/11/039131,biorxiv,2016,aa843baf-c48b-42d0-b119-a96471821b30,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/11/039131.full.pdf

Given the tsunami of sequence information linked to diseases from next generation sequencing — in need for interpretation — making structural information readily available to research scientists is a tremendous opportunity for medical discovery. The Twelve Elements are conceptual and are intended to entice developers to architect software components and APIs, and to gather together as a community around common goals and open source software.

For example, spontaneous recovery is explained by supposing that the animal replays its previous trials during the interval between extinction and test. These include earlier acquisition trials as well as recent extinction trials, and thus there is a gradual re-acquisition of the conditioned response. We present simulation results for the simplest version of this replay idea, where the trial memory is assumed empty at the beginning of an experiment, all experienced trials are stored and none removed, and sampling from the memory is performed at random.

Very Early Responses to Colour Stimuli Detected in Prestriate Visual Cortex by Magnetoencephalography (MEG)," View ORCID ProfileYoshihito Shigihara, Hideyuki Hoshi, Semir Zeki",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Our previous studies with the visual motion and form systems show that visual stimuli belonging to these categories trigger much earlier latency responses from the visual cortex than previously supposed and that the source of the earliest signals can be located in either the prestriate cortex or in both the striate (V1) and prestriate cortex. This is consistent with the known anatomical connections since, in addition to the classical retino-geniculo-striate cortex input to the prestriate visual areas, there are direct anatomical inputs from both the lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar that reach the prestriate visual cortex without passing through striate cortex. In pursuing our studies, we thought it especially interesting to study another cardinal visual attribute, namely colour, to learn whether colour stimuli also provoke very early responses, at less than 50 ms from visual cortex. To address the question, we asked participants to view stimuli that changed in colour and used magneto-encephalography to detect very early responses (< 50 ms) in the occipital visual cortex. Our results show that coloured stimuli also provoke an early cortical response (M30), with an average peak time at 31.7 ms, thus bringing the colour system into line with the visual motion and form systems.

Tools and techniques for computational reproducibility,"Stephen R Piccolo, Michael B Frampton",Now published in GigaScience. 2016,"When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. Due to the deterministic nature of most computer programs, the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced due to complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed--and due to limitations in how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges. Here we describe seven such strategies.

The rate of transient beta frequency events predicts impaired function across tasks and species," View ORCID ProfileHyeyoung Shin, Robert Law, Shawn Tsutsui, Christopher I Moore, Stephanie R Jones",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Beta frequency oscillations (15-29Hz) are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity. Beta power is predictive of many healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. Recent evidence shows that in non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power ""events"". As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect accumulated changes in the number, power, duration, and/or frequency span of the events. We show for the first time that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human sensory neocortex reflects a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e., the rate of events. Further, high power beta events close to the time of the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. This result is consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and is conserved in local field potential (LFP) recordings of mice performing a detection task. Our findings suggest transient brain rhythms are best viewed as a ""rate metric"" in their impact on function, and provides a new framework for understanding and manipulating functionally relevant rhythmic events.","['shinehyeyoung@gmail.com', 'stephanie_jones@brown.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/128769,biorxiv,2017,2b741b04-8c4e-4aca-8850-a368f8229eb7,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/128769.full.pdf

Here we used in vivo 2-photon imaging with Oregon Green Bapta (OGB) to study neuropil visual responses to moving gratings in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1. We found neuropil responses to be more reliable and more strongly modulated than neighboring somatic activity. Furthermore, stimulus independent modulations in neuropil activity, i.e., noise correlations, were highly coherent across the cortical surface, up to distances of at least 200 μm. Pairwise neuropil-to-neuropil-patch noise correlation strength was much higher than cell-to-cell noise correlation strength and depended strongly on brain state, decreasing in quiet wakefulness relative to light anesthesia. The profile of neuropil noise correlation strength decreased gently with distance, dropping by ~12% at a distance of 200 μm.  This was comparatively slower than the profile of cell-to-cell noise correlations, which dropped by ~30% at 200 μm. Interestingly, in spite of the 'salt & pepper' organization of orientation and direction encoding across mouse V1 neurons, populations of neuropil patches, even of moderately large size (radius ~100μm), showed high accuracy for discriminating perpendicularly moving gratings commensurate to the accuracy of corresponding cell populations. These observations underscore the dynamic nature of the functional organization of neuropil activity.","['lee.sangkyun@gmail.com', 'smsmirnakis@partners.org']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/06/113019,biorxiv,2017,a1f21cf0-5d8c-45e4-8b40-961661dc43e3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/06/113019.full.pdf

To understand the relationship, we conducted predation experiments in outdoor tanks and a semi-natural stream with exposure to local predators. Two different ranges of fork lengths of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were examined as prey sizes. Camera trap data showed that grey herons (Ardea cinerea) were the primary predator animal in the system, and that most herons utilized shallow areas in the morning or evening. Increasing the density of stocked salmon brought in more grey herons. More importantly, predation by grey herons resulted in the survival rate of larger salmon being significantly lower than that of the smaller salmon.

Mitochondrial Dual-coding Genes in Trypanosoma brucei,"Laura E. Kirby, Donna Koslowsky",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Trypanosoma brucei is transmitted between mammalian hosts by the tsetse fly. In the mammal, they are exclusively extracellular, continuously replicating within the bloodstream. During this stage, the mitochondrion lacks a functional electron transport chain (ETC). Successful transition to the fly, requires activation of the ETC and ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation. This life cycle leads to a major problem: in the bloodstream, the mitochondrial genes are not under selection and are subject to genetic drift that endangers their integrity. Exacerbating this, T. brucei undergoes repeated population bottlenecks as they evade the host immune system that would create additional forces of genetic drift. These parasites possess several unique genetic features, including RNA editing of mitochondrial transcripts. RNA editing creates open reading frames by the guided insertion and deletion of U-residues within the mRNA. A major question in the field has been why this metabolically expensive system of RNA editing would evolve and persist. Here, we show that many of the edited mRNAs can alter the choice of start codon and the open reading frame by alternative editing of the 5' end. Analyses of mutational bias indicate that six of the mitochondrial genes may be dual-coding and that RNA editing allows access to both reading frames. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes can protect genetic information by essentially hiding a non-selected gene within one that remains under selection. Thus, the complex RNA editing system found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift in non-selective conditions.",['koslowsk@msu.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187732,biorxiv,2017,093d618c-3aad-48ac-99d8-4643272e719f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187732.full.pdf

We argue that STR variants are more likely than single nucleotide variants to have epistatic interactions, reiterate the need for targeted assays to accurately genotype STRs, and call for more appropriate statistical methods in detecting STR-phenotype associations.

Yet, despite their diversity and importance, accurate divergence times are still unknown for most demosponge clades. The estimation of demosponge divergence time is key to answering fundamental questions like e.g. the origin of Demospongiae, their diversification and historical biogeography. Molecular sequence data alone is not informative on an absolute time scale, and therefore needs to be calibrated with additional data such as fossils. Here, we apply the fossilized birth-death model (FBD), which has the advantage, compared to strict node dating with the oldest fossil occurrences, that it allows for the inclusion of young and old fossils in the analysis of divergence time. We use desma-bearing sponges, a diverse group of demosponges that form rigid skeletons and have a rich and continuous fossil record dating back to the Cambrian (~500 Ma), aiming to date the demosponge radiation and constrain the timing of key evolutionary events, like the transition from marine to freshwater habitats. To do so, we assembled mitochondrial genomes of six desma-bearing demosponges from size-selected reduced representation genomic libraries and apply a fossilized birth-death model including 30 fossils and 33 complete demosponge mitochondrial genomes to infer a dated phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study supports a Neoproterozoic origin of Demospongiae. Novel age estimates for the split of freshwater and marine sponges dating back to the Carboniferous and the previously assumed Recent (~18 Ma) diversification of freshwater sponges is supported. Moreover, we provide detailed age estimates for a possible diversification of Tetractinellidae (~315 Ma), the Astrophorina (~240 Ma), the Spirophorina (~120 Ma) and the family Corallistidae (~188 Ma) all of which are considered as key groups for dating the Demospongiae, due to their extraordinary rich and continuous fossil history.",['woerheide@lmu.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/09/159806,biorxiv,2017,3b270d45-1cf0-4a27-aa17-10598205a325,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/09/159806.full.pdf
Hilbert-Schmidt and Sobol sensitivity indices for static and time series Wnt signaling measurements in colorectal cancer - Part A,shriprakash sinha,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to (1) explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, (2) analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and (3) investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

Compared to the one of wild populations, the microbiota of laboratory-reared flies is less diverse, and comprises fewer bacterial taxa; nevertheless, the main commensal bacteria found in fly microbiota always belong to the Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae families. The bacterial communities associated with the fly are environmentally acquired, and the partners engage in a perpetual re-association process. Adult flies constantly ingest and excrete microbes from and onto their feeding substrate, which are then transmitted to the next generation developing within this shared habitat. We wanted to analyze the potential changes in the bacterial community during its reciprocal transfer between the two compartments of the niche (i.e. the fly and the diet). To address this question, we used a diverse, wild-derived microbial community and analyzed its relationship with the fly population and the nutritive substrate in a given habitat. Here we show that the community was overall well maintained upon transmission to a new niche, to a new fly population and to their progeny, illustrating the stable association of a Drosophila-derived microbiota with its fly partner and the nutritional environment.

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronisation in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronised bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with non-trivial temporal and population statistics.

Finally, the model we develop here, in combination with our experimental data including both protein synthesis and degradation, predicts changes in proteome remodeling under a variety of cellular perturbations.  pSILAC therefore provides an important complement to ribosome profiling in directly measuring proteome dynamics under conditions of cellular stress.","['arun.wiita@ucsf.edu', 'yss@berkeley.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/14/087486,biorxiv,2016,c316ca50-2a12-4982-8a48-89eee3b4d82d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/14/087486.full.pdf
Cortical rhythms are modulated by respiration,"Detlef H Heck, Samuel S McAfee, Yu Liu, Abbas Babajani-Feremi, Roozbeh Rezaie, Walter J Freeman, James W Wheless, Andrew C Papanicolaou, Miklos Ruszinko, Robert Kozma",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"The brain generates oscillatory neuronal activity at a broad range of frequencies and the presence and amplitude of certain oscillations at specific times and in specific brain regions are highly correlated with states of arousal, sleep, and with a wide range of cognitive processes. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the generation of brain rhythms are poorly understood, particularly for low-frequency oscillations. We recently reported that respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity causes delta band (0.5 - 4 Hz) oscillatory neuronal activity in the whisker sensory (barrel) cortex in mice. Furthermore, gamma oscillations (30 - 100Hz), which are widely implicated in cognitive processing, were power-modulated in synchrony with the respiratory rhythm. These findings link afferent sensory activity caused by respiration directly to cortical rhythms associated with cognitive functions. Here we review the related literature and present new evidence to propose that respiration has a direct influence on oscillatory cortical activity, including gamma oscillations, and on transitions between synchronous and asynchronous cortical network states (marked by phase transitions). Oscillatory cortical activity, as well as phase transitions, has been implicated in cognitive functions, potentially linking respiratory phase to cognitive processing. We further argue that respiratory influence on cortical activity is present in most, and possibly in all areas of the neocortex in mice and humans. We furthermore suggest that respiration had a role in modulating cortical rhythms from early mammalian evolution. Early mammals relied strongly on their olfactory sense and had proportionately large olfactory bulbs. We propose that to this day the respiratory rhythm remains an integral element of dynamic cortical activity in mammals. We argue that breathing modulates all cortical functions, including cognitive and emotional processes, which could elucidate the well-documented but largely unexplained effects of respiratory exercises on mood and cognitive function.",['dheck@uthsc.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/16/049007,biorxiv,2016,fd4d6d6d-edea-450d-9871-1ac9dad896c8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/16/049007.full.pdf
The physical boundaries of public goods cooperation between surface-attached bacterial cells,"Michael Weigert, Rolf Kümmerli",Now published in Proceedings B. 2017,"Bacteria secrete a variety of compounds important for nutrient scavenging, competition mediation and infection establishment. While there is a general consensus that secreted compounds can be shared and therefore have social consequences for the bacterial collective, we know little about the physical limits of such bacterial social interactions. Here, we address this issue by studying the sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores between surface-attached microcolonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using single-cell fluorescent microscopy, we show that siderophores, secreted by producers, quickly reach non-producers within a range of 100 μm, and significantly boost their fitness. Producers in turn respond to variation in sharing efficiency by adjusting their pyoverdine investment levels. These social effects wane with larger cell-to-cell distances and on hard surfaces. Thus, our findings reveal the boundaries of compound sharing, and show that sharing is particularly relevant between nearby yet physically separated bacteria on soft surfaces, matching realistic natural conditions.","['rolf.kuemmerli@uzh.ch', 'michael_weigert@gmx.net']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/14/119032,biorxiv,2017,1ee37702-efde-4b79-85a2-098960c4949f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/14/119032.full.pdf

With the aim of unravelling the link between genome evolution and ecological versatility of L. plantarum, we analysed the genomes of 54 L. plantarum strains isolated from different environments. Phylogenomic analyses coupled with the study of genetic functional divergence and gene-trait matching analysis revealed a mixed distribution of the strains, which was uncoupled from their environmental origin. Our findings demonstrate the high complexity of L. plantarum evolution, revealing the absence of specific genomic signatures marking adaptations of this species towards the diverse habitats it is associated with.

Soft sweeps and beyond: Understanding the patterns and probabilities of selection footprints under rapid adaptation,"Joachim Hermisson, Pleuni S Pennings",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"1. The tempo and mode of adaptive evolution determine how natural selection shapes patterns of genetic diversity in DNA polymorphism data. While slow mutation-limited adaptation leads to classical footprints of “hard” selective sweeps, these patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic variation or on recurrent new mutation. In the past decade, corresponding footprints of “soft” selective sweeps have been described both in theoretical models and in empirical data.  2. Here, we summarize the key theoretical concepts and contrast model predictions with observed patterns in Drosophila, humans, and microbes.  3. Evidence in all cases shows that “soft” patterns of rapid adaptation are frequent. However, theory and data also point to a role of complex adaptive histories in rapid evolution.  4. While existing theory allows for important implications on the tempo and mode of the adaptive process, complex footprints observed in data are, as yet, insufficiently covered by models.

Moreover, the contributions of various network properties to population coupling are largely unexplored.  To this end, we recorded the membrane potential (V) and the nearby LFP in the visual cortex of the turtle ex vivo wholebrain preparation during ongoing and visually-evoked activity.

It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. 
The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). 
Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared to phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.",['marc.baechinger@hest.ethz.ch'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/31/122820,biorxiv,2017,061d431c-769b-4765-9e47-8ec71136b07a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/31/122820.full.pdf

Under a nutritional adequacy hypothesis, an interaction between breastfeeding and genetic variants associated with endogenous LC-PUFAs synthesis might be expected. However, the literature on this topic is controversial.  Methods and Findings: We investigated this GenexEnvironment interaction in a de novo meta-analysis involving >12,000 individuals in the primary analysis, and >45,000 individuals in a secondary analysis using relaxed inclusion criteria. Our primary analysis used ever breastfeeding, FADS2 polymorphisms rs174575 and rs1535 coded assuming a recessive effect of the G allele, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in Z scores. Using random effects meta-analysis, ever breastfeeding was associated with 0.17 (95% CI: 0.03; 0.32) higher Z scores in IQ, or about 2.1 points. There was no strong evidence of interaction, with pooled covariate-adjusted interaction coefficients (i.e., difference between genetic groups of the difference in IQ Z scores comparing ever with never breastfed individuals) of 0.12 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.43) and 0.06 (95% CI: -0.16; 0.27) for the rs174575 and rs1535 variants, respectively. Secondary analyses corroborated these results. In studies with ≥5.85 and <5.85 months of breastfeeding duration, pooled estimates for the rs174575 variant were 0.50 (95% CI: -0.06; 1.06) and 0.14 (95% CI: -0.10; 0.38), respectively, and 0.27 (95% CI: -0.28; 0.82) and -0.01 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.16) for the rs1535 variant. However, between-group comparisons were underpowered.  Conclusions: Our findings do not support an interaction between ever breastfeeding and FADS2 polymorphisms. However, our subgroup analysis raises the possibility that breastfeeding supplies LC-PUFAs requirements for cognitive development (if such threshold exists) if it lasts for some (currently unknown) time.

We detected many trans-meQTL SNPs that affect expression levels of nearby transcription factors (including NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3), while the corresponding trans-meQTL CpG sites frequently coincide with its respective binding site.

Selection-Driven Cost-Efficiency Optimisation Of Transcript Sequences Determines The Rate Of Gene Sequence Evolution In Bacteria,"Emily A. Seward, Steven Kelly",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Due to genetic redundancy, multiple synonymous codons can code for the same amino acid. However synonymous codons are not used equally and this biased codon use varies between different organisms. Through analysis of 1,320 bacterial genomes we show that bacteria are under genome-wide selection to reduce resource allocation to mRNA production. This is achieved by simultaneously decreasing transcript biosynthetic cost and increasing transcript translational efficiency, with highly expressed genes under the greatest selection. We show that tRNA gene copy number alters the cost-efficiency trade-off of synonymous codons such that for many species it is difficult to both minimise transcript cost and maximise transcript translational efficiency to an equal extent. Finally, we show that genes highly optimised to reduce cost and increase efficiency show reduced rates of synonymous and non-synonymous mutation. This provides a simple mechanistic explanation for variation in evolutionary rate between genes that depends on selection-driven cost-efficiency optimisation of the transcript. These findings reveal how optimisation of resource allocation to mRNA synthesis is a critical factor that determines both the evolution and composition of genes.",['steven.kelly@plants.ox.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/11/136861,biorxiv,2017,98e8ee6d-89e2-4ec9-ae94-9da3db43f5ff,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/11/136861.full.pdf

Convergent evolution as an indicator for selection during acute HIV-1 infection,"Frederic Bertels, Karin J Metzner, Roland R Regoes",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Convergent evolution describes the process of different populations acquiring similar phenotypes or genotypes. For complex organisms with large genomes it is unlikely to converge to the same genotype, although there are examples where this happens under very strong selection. In contrast, for viruses with very small genomes and high mutation rates, even without selection it is possible that different virus population acquire the same mutation. Here we measure the number of convergent mutations in a well-studied dataset of full-length HIV-1 env genes sampled from HIV-1 infected individuals during early infection. We compare this data to a neutral model and find an excess of convergent mutations in the env genes. These differences are likely to confer a selective advantage as they occur significantly more often in gp41, the part of the env gene involved in fusion with the target cell. Interestingly, convergent mutations are not significantly more likely to occur in genetically diverse regions of the genome and are also not significantly more likely to be synonymous compared to a neutral model, highlighting the highly non-neutral nature of many synonymous sites in the HIV-1 genome. Non-convergent mutations, on the other hand, are significantly more likely to be synonymous and the non-synonymous proportion of the mutations occur significantly more often in highly diverse regions of the env gene than randomly distributed mutations.

Modularity Facilitates Flexible Tuning Of Plastic And Evolutionary Gene Expression Responses During Early Divergence," View ORCID ProfileHannu Makinen, Tiina Savilammi, Spiros Papakostas, Erica Leder, Asbjorn Vollestad, Craig Primmer",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Gene expression changes have been recognized as important drivers of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Little is known about the relative roles of plastic and evolutionary responses in complex gene expression networks during the early stages of divergence. Large gene expression data sets coupled with in silico methods for identifying co-expressed modules now enable systems genetics approaches also in non-model species for better understanding of gene expression responses during early divergence. Here, we combined gene co-expression analyses with population genetics to separate plastic and population (evolutionary) effects in expression networks using small salmonid populations as a model system. We show that plastic and population effects were highly variable among the six identified modules and that the plastic effects explained larger proportion of the total eigengene expression than population effects. A more detailed analysis of the population effects using a QST - FST comparison across 16622 annotated transcripts revealed that gene expression followed neutral expectations within modules and at the global level. Furthermore, two modules showed enrichment for genes coding for early developmental traits that have been previously identified as important phenotypic traits in thermal responses in the same model system indicating that co-expression analysis can capture expression patterns underlying ecologically important traits. We suggest that module-specific responses may facilitate the flexible tuning of expression levels to local thermal conditions. Overall, our study indicates that plasticity and neutral evolution are the main drivers of gene expression variance in the early stages of thermal adaptation in this system.",['hasama@utu.fi'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179424,biorxiv,2017,ae425389-00ba-4330-a674-86bef5524b3f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/179424.full.pdf
Circumstantial Evidence?

Genome scale surveys of human disease variation generate volumes of data that far exceed capabilities for laboratory characterization, and importantly also create a substantial burden of type I error. By incorporating a variety of functional annotations as predictors, such as regulatory and protein coding elements, statistical learning has been widely investigated as a mechanism for the prioritization of genetic variants that are more likely to be associated with complex disease. These methods offer a hope of identification of sufficiently large numbers of truly associated variants, to make cost-effective the large-scale functional characterization necessary to progress genome scale experiments. We compared the results from three published prioritization procedures which use different statistical learning algorithms and different predictors with regard to the quantity, type and coding of the functional annotations. In this paper we also explore different combinations of algorithm and annotation set. We train the models in 60% of the data and reserve the remainder for testing the accuracy. As an application, we tested which methodology performed the best for prioritizing sub-genome-wide-significant variants using data from the first and second rounds of a large schizophrenia meta-analysis by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Results suggest that all methods have considerable (and similar) predictive accuracies (AUCs 0.64-0.71). However, predictive accuracy results obtained from the test set do not always reflect results obtained from the application to the schizophrenia meta-analysis. In conclusion, a variety of algorithms and annotations seem to have a similar potential to effectively enrich true risk variants in genome scale datasets, however none offer more than incremental improvement in prediction.

We identify many actin regulators in replicating nuclei from Xenopus egg extracts, and show that in human cells, nuclear actin filaments form in early G1 and disassemble prior to S-phase. In either system, treatments that stabilise nuclear actin filaments abrogate nuclear transport and initiation of DNA replication. Mechanistically, actin directly binds RanGTP-importin complexes and disruption of its dynamics hinders cargo release. This prevents both nuclear pore complex (NPC) formation and active nuclear transport, which we show is required throughout DNA replication.

Sampling by dried blood spot (DBS) finger-pricks can be performed safely and efficiently with minimal resource and storage requirements compared with venous blood (VB). Here, we evaluate the use of selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) to sequence the P. falciparum genome from clinical DBS samples, and compare the results to current methods using leucodepleted VB. Parasite DNA with high (> 95%) human DNA contamination was selectively amplified by Phi29 polymerase using short oligonucleotide probes of 8-12 mers as primers. These primers were selected on the basis of their differential frequency of binding the desired (P. falciparum DNA) and contaminating (human) genomes. Using sWGA method, we sequenced clinical samples from 156 malaria patients, including 120 paired samples for head-to-head comparison of DBS and leucodepleted VB. Greater than 18-fold enrichment of P. falciparum DNA was achieved from DBS extracts.  The parasitaemia threshold to achieve >5x coverage for 50% of the genome was 0.03% (40 parasites per 200 white blood cells). Over 99% SNP concordance between VB and DBS samples was achieved after excluding missing calls. The sWGA methods described here provide a reliable and scalable way of generating P. falciparum genome sequence data from DBS samples.  Our data indicate that it will be possible to get good quality sequence data on most if not all drug resistance loci from the majority of symptomatic malaria patients.

Ferox Trout are large, long-lived piscivorous Brown Trout (Salmo trutta). Due to their exceptionally large size, Ferox Trout are highly sought after by anglers while their life-history strategy, which includes delayed maturation, multiphasic growth and extended longevity, is of interest to ecological and evolutionary modelers. However, despite their recreational and theoretical importance, little is known about the typical abundance of Ferox Trout.
Methods. To rectify this situation a 16 year angling-based mark-recapture study was conducted on Loch Rannoch, which at 19 km2 is one of the largest lakes in the United Kingdom.
Results. A hierarchical Bayesian Jolly-Seber analysis of the data suggest that if individual differences in catchability are negligible the population of Ferox Trout in Loch Rannoch in 2009 was approximately 71 fish. The results also suggest that a single, often unaccompanied, highly-experienced angler was able to catch roughly 8% of the available fish on an annual basis.
Discussion. It is recommended that anglers adopt a precautionary approach and release all trout with a fork length ≥ 400 mm caught by trolling in Loch Rannoch.

Computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses to the affordance properties of visual scenes," View ORCID ProfileMichael F. Bonner, Russell A. Epstein",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the complex internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we developed a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes: that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that the CNN was highly predictive of OPA representations, and, importantly, that it accounted for the portion of OPA variance that reflected the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal computations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations.

Instead, the dominant approach employs parcellations that cannot model the continuous nature of the topography, nor accommodate overlapping cortical projections in the striatum.

Balanced Oscillatory Coupling Improves Information Flow,"Erik J Peterson, Bradley Voytek",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2015,"All animals are able to rapidly change their behavior. The neural basis of such flexibility requires that groups of distant neural ensembles rapidly alter communications with selectivity and fidelity. Low frequency oscillations are a strong candidate for how neurons coordinate communication via the dynamic instantiation of functional networks. These dynamic networks are argued to rapidly guide the flow of information, with the presumption that stronger oscillations more strongly influence information flow. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence or theoretical support for how oscillatory activity might enhance information flow. Here we introduce a novel computational model for oscillatory neural communication and show that, rather than the strength of the oscillation, it is the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity that has the largest effect on information flow. When coupling an oscillation and spiking has balanced excitatory-inhibitory inputs, information flow is enhanced via improved discriminability between signal and noise. In contrast, when coupling is unbalanced, driven either by excessive excitation or inhibition, information flow is obstructed, regardless of the strength of the oscillation. A multitude of neuropathologies, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and autism, are associated with oscillatory disruptions and excitation-inhibition imbalances.

Oscillatory signatures of crossmodal congruence effects: An EEG investigation employing a visuotactile pattern matching paradigm,"Florian Göschl, Uwe Friese, Jonathan Daume, Peter König, Andreas K. Engel",Now published in NeuroImage. 2015,"Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is an ongoing debate about the neurophysiological mechanisms of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (< 30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms while human participants were engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching paradigm and analyzed oscillatory power in the theta- (4-7 Hz), alpha- (8-13 Hz) and beta-bands (13-30 Hz). Employing the same physical stimuli, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visuotactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics related to crossmodal congruence within the two tasks were observed in the beta-band for crossmodal target detection, as well as in the theta-band for congruence evaluation. Contrasting ongoing activity preceding visuotactile stimulation between the two tasks revealed differences in the alpha- and beta-bands. Source reconstruction of between-task differences showed prominent involvement of premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, somatosensory association cortex and the supramarginal gyrus. These areas not only exhibited more involvement in the pre-stimulus interval for target detection compared to congruence evaluation, but were also crucially involved in post-stimulus differences related to crossmodal stimulus congruence within the detection task. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are functionally relevant for integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visuotactile pattern matching in the current study.",['f.goeschl@uke.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/04/15/014092,biorxiv,2015,755bb816-4d95-4cca-9d0f-dbe23157f8c1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/04/15/014092.full.pdf

Neuronal networks accomplish such tasks by learning different sensory maps at several stages of neural hierarchy, such that different neurons fire selectively to reflect different internal or external patterns and states. The exact mechanisms of such map formation processes in the brain are not totally understood. Here we study the mechanism by which a simple recurrent/reentrant neuronal network accomplish group selection and discrimination to different inputs in order to generate sensory maps. We describe the conditions and mechanism of transition from a rhythmic epileptic state (in which all neurons fire synchronized and indiscriminately to any input) to a winner-take-all state in which only a subset of neurons fire for a specific input. We prove an analytic condition under which a stable bump solution and a soft winner-take-all state can emerge from the local recurrent excitation-inhibition interactions in a three-layer spiking network with distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and demonstrate the importance of surround inhibitory connection topology on the stability of dynamic patterns in spiking neural network.",['yanqingchen2000@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/26/077396,biorxiv,2016,bfc62ea4-b6a7-49e2-9029-85de1339f7da,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/26/077396.full.pdf
Distinct sources of deterministic and stochastic components of action timing decisions in rodent frontal cortex,"Masayoshi Murakami, Hanan Shteingart, Yonatan Loewenstein, Zachary F. Mainen",Now published in Neuron. 2016,"The selection and timing of actions are subject to determinate influences such as sensory cues and internal state as well as to effectively stochastic variability. Although stochastic choice mechanisms are assumed by many theoretical models, their origin and mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigated this issue by studying how neural circuits in the frontal cortex determine action timing in rats performing a waiting task. Electrophysiological recordings from two regions necessary for this behavior, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and secondary motor cortex (M2), revealed an unexpected functional dissociation. Both areas encoded deterministic biases in action timing, but only M2 neurons reflected stochastic trial-by-trial fluctuations. This differential coding was reflected in distinct timescales of neural dynamics in the two frontal cortical areas. These results suggest a two-stage model in which stochastic components of action timing decisions are injected by circuits downstream of those carrying deterministic bias signals.","['zmainen@neuro.fchampalimaud.org', 'masayoshi.murakami@neuro.fchampalimaud.org']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/22/088963,biorxiv,2016,13a7c96e-4a8c-4643-bf51-9a8dea2e78ab,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/22/088963.full.pdf

Kanold, Min Wu,  View ORCID ProfileBehtash Babadi",Now published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. 2016,"Objective: Common biological measurements are in the form of noisy convolutions of signals of interest with possibly unknown and transient blurring kernels. Examples include EEG and calcium imaging data. Thus, signal deconvolution of these measurements is crucial in understanding the underlying biological processes. The objective of this paper is to develop fast and stable solutions for signal deconvolution from noisy, blurred and undersampled data, where the signals are in the form of discrete events distributed in time and space. Methods: We introduce compressible state-space models as a framework to model and estimate such discrete events. These state-space models admit abrupt changes in the states and have a convergent transition matrix, and are coupled with compressive linear measurements. We consider a dynamic compressive sensing optimization problem and develop a fast solution, using two nested Expectation Maximization algorithms, to jointly estimate the states as well as their transition matrices. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on the dynamics, we prove optimal stability guarantees for the recovery of the states and present a method for the identification of the underlying discrete events with precise confidence bounds. Results: We present simulation studies as well as application to calcium deconvolution and sleep spindle detection, which verify our theoretical results and show significant improvement over existing techniques. Conclusion: Our results show that by explicitly modeling the dynamics of the underlying signals, it is possible to construct signal deconvolution solutions that are scalable, statistically robust, and achieve high temporal resolution. Significance: Our proposed methodology provides a framework for modeling and deconvolution of noisy, blurred, and undersampled measurements in a fast and stable fashion, with potential application to a wide range of biological data.","['liuji@umd.edu', 'korzecho@umd.edu', 'daniel.nagode@gmail.com', 'pkanold@umd.edu', 'kaazemi@umd.edu', 'behtash@umd.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092643,biorxiv,2016,9296594b-ef4e-40cf-8ced-da38b399a6b5,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092643.full.pdf

When rats trained on familiar stimuli were exposed to unfamiliar stimuli, choice responses varied significantly across individuals. We examined how variability in MFC neural processing could mediate this individual difference and constructed a network model to replicate this. Our model suggested that susceptibility of neural trajectories is a crucial determinant of the observed choice variability. The model predicted that trial-by-trial variability of trajectories are correlated with the susceptibility, and hence also correlated with the individual difference.

The evolutionary dynamics of influenza A virus within and between human hosts,"John T. McCrone, Robert J. Woods, Emily T. Martin, Ryan E. Malosh, Arnold S. Monto,  View ORCID ProfileAdam S. Lauring",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"A complete understanding of influenza virus evolution requires studies at all levels, as viral evolutionary dynamics may differ across spatial and temporal scales. The relative contribution of deterministic processes, such as selection, and stochastic processes, such as genetic drift, is influenced by viral effective population size. While the global evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) is dominated by the positive selection of novel antigenic variants that circulate in the tropics, much less is known about influenza virus evolution within and between human hosts. With few exceptions, most of the available data derive from studies of chronically infected, immunocompromised hosts, experimental infections with attenuated viruses, or animal models. Here we define the evolutionary dynamics of IAV in human hosts through next generation sequencing of 249 upper respiratory specimens from 200 individuals collected over 6290 person-seasons of observation. Because these viruses were collected over 5 seasons from individuals in a prospective community-based cohort, they are broadly representative of natural human infections with seasonal viruses. Within host genetic diversity was low, and we found little evidence for positive selection of minority variants. We used viral sequence data from 35 serially sampled individuals to estimate a within host effective population size of 30-50. This estimate is consistent across several models and robust to their underlying assumptions. We also identified 43 epidemiologically linked and genetically validated transmission pairs. Maximum likelihood optimization of multiple transmission models estimates an effective transmission bottleneck of 1-2 distinct genomes. Our data suggest that positive selection of novel viral variants is inefficient at the level of the individual host and that genetic drift and other stochastic processes dominate the within and between host evolution of influenza A viruses.",['alauring@med.umich.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/15/176362,biorxiv,2017,29f71835-128c-4c78-b616-03a1ec2b4107,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/15/176362.full.pdf
Reconstructing subclonal composition and evolution from whole genome sequencing of tumors,"Amit G. Deshwar, Shankar Vembu, Christina K. Yung, Gun Ho Jang, Lincoln Stein, Quaid Morris",Now published in Genome Biology. 2014,"Tumors often contain multiple, genetically distinct subpopulations of cancerous cells. These so-called subclonal populations are defined by distinct somatic mutations that include point mutations such as single nucleotide variants and small indels ? collectively called simple somatic mutations (SSMs) ? as well as larger structural changes that result in copy number variations (CNVs). In some cases, the genotype and prevalence of these subpopulations can be reconstructed based on high-throughput, short-read sequencing of DNA in one or more tumor samples. To date, no automated SSM-based subclonal reconstructions have been attempted on WGS data; and CNV-based reconstructions are limited to tumors with two or fewer cancerous subclonal populations and with a small number of CNVs.

We describe a new automated method, PhyloWGS, that can be applied to WGS data from one or more tumor samples to perform subclonal reconstruction based on both CNVs and SSMs. PhyloWGS successfully recovers the composition of mixtures of a highly rearranged TGCA cell line when a CNV-based method fails. On WGS data with average read depth of 40 from five time-series chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, PhyloWGS recovers the same tumor phylogeny previously reconstructed using deep targeted resequencing.  To further explore the limits of WGS-based subclonal reconstruction, we ran PhyloWGS on simulated data: PhyloWGS can reliably reconstruct as many as three cancerous subpopulations based on 30-50x coverage WGS data from a single tumor sample with 10?s to 1000?s of SSMs per subpopulation. At least five cancerous subpopulations can be reconstructed if provided with read depths of 200 or more. 

PhyloWGS is the first automated method that can be applied to WGS tumor data  that accurately reconstructs the frequency, genotype and phylogeny of the subclonal populations based on both SSMs and CNVs. It also provides a principled, automated approach to combining overlapping SSM and CNV data. By demonstrating the utility of PhyloWGS on medium depth WGS data, including from examples with highly rearranged chromosomes, we have greatly expanded the range of tumors for which subclonal reconstruction is possible.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/06/27/006692,biorxiv,2014,8ba74f27-c000-48b1-ad8b-597d86a4b730,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/06/27/006692.full.pdf

Current biomedical research needs to leverage and exploit the large amount of information reported in publications.

The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications.
Conclusions
BeFree is a novel  text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources, raising several issues on data prioritization and curation. We propose that joint analysis of text mined data with data curated by experts appears as a suitable approach to both assess data quality and highlight novel and interesting information.","['abravo@imim.es', 'jpinero@imim.es', 'nqueralt@imim.es', 'rautschy@gmail.com', 'lfurlong@imim.es']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/07/24/007443,biorxiv,2014,651de7e4-60d3-4d59-9361-fbbb4683f2f6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/07/24/007443.full.pdf

We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate tasks in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-based approach to recognize workflow components: data and control flows.

Ultra-Accurate Complex Disorder Prediction: Case Study Of Neurodevelopmental Disorders,"Linh Huynh, Fereydoun Hormozdiari",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Early prediction of complex disorders (e.g., autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders) is one of the fundamental goals of precision medicine and personalized genomics. An early prediction of complex disorders can have a significant impact on increasing the effectiveness of interventions and treatments in improving the prognosis and, in many cases, enhancing the quality of life in the affected patients. Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders. We provide a novel formulation for the Ultra-Accurate Disorder Prediction (UADP) problem and develop a novel combinatorial framework for solving this problem. The primary goal of this novel framework, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), is to make an accurate prediction for a subset of affected cases while having virtually zero false positive predictions for unaffected samples. Note that in the Odin framework we will take advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8% of autism cases without known recurrent mutated genes in the training set and with a less than 0.5% false positive prediction based on our analysis of unaffected controls.

An Analysis of Cochlear Implant Distortion from a User's Perspective,Barry David Jacobson,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"We describe our first-hand experience with a cochlear implant (CI), being both a recent recipient and a hearing researcher. We note the promising loudness, but very unpleasant distortion, which makes understanding speech difficult in many environments, including in noise, on the phone or through the radio. We also discuss the extreme unpleasantness of music, which makes recognizing familiar melodies very difficult. We investigate the causes of the above problems through mathematical analysis and computer simulations of sound mixtures, and find that surprisingly, the culprit appears to be non-biological in origin, but primarily due to the envelope-based signal processing algorithms currently used. This distortion is generated before the signal even enters the cochlea. Hence, the long-held belief that inter-electrode interference or current spreading is the cause, appears incorrect. We explain that envelope processing may have been originally instituted based on an inaccurate understanding of the role of place coding vs. temporal coding, or alternatively, because of an incorrect analogy to radio modulation theory.

ConsensusDriver Improves Upon Individual Algorithms For Predicting Driver Alterations In Different Cancer Types And Individual Patients — A Toolbox For Precision Oncology,"Denis Bertrand, Sibyl Drissler, Burton Chia, Jia Yu Koh, Chenhao Li, Chayaporn Suphavilai, Iain Beehuat Tan, Niranjan Nagarajan",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: In recent years, several large-scale cancer genomics studies have helped generate detailed molecular profiling datasets for many cancer types and thousands of patients. These datasets provide a unique resource for studying cancer driver prediction methods and their utility for precision oncology, both to predict driver genetic alterations in patient subgroups (e.g. defined by histology or clinical phenotype) or even individual patients.  Methods: We performed the most comprehensive assessment to date of 18 driver gene prediction methods, on more than 3,400 tumour samples, from 15 cancer types, to determine their suitability in guiding precision medicine efforts. These methods have diverse approaches, which can be classified into five categories: functional impact on proteins in general (FI) or specific to cancer (FIC), cohort-based analysis for recurrent mutations (CBA), mutations with expression correlation (MEC) and methods that use gene interaction network-based analysis (INA).  Results: The performance of driver prediction methods varies considerably, with concordance with a gold-standard varying from 9% to 68%. FI methods show relatively poor performance (concordance <22%) while CBA methods provide conservative results, but require large sample sizes for high sensitivity. INA methods, through the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data, and FIC methods, by training cancer-specific models, provide the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. As the methods were found to predict different subsets of drivers, we propose a novel consensus-based approach, ConsensusDriver, which significantly improves the quality of predictions (20% increase in sensitivity). This tool can be applied to predict driver alterations in patient subgroups (e.g. defined by histology or clinical phenotype) or even individual patients.  Conclusion: Existing cancer driver prediction methods are based on very different assumptions and each of them can only detect a particular subset of driver events. Consensus-based methods, like ConsensusDriver, are thus a promising approach to harness the strengths of different driver prediction paradigms.","['bertrandd@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 's.drissler@alumni.ubc.ca', 'chiakhb@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 'kohjy@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 'lich@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 'suphavilaic99@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 'tanbhi@gis.a-star.edu.sg', 'nagarajann@gis.a-star.edu.sg']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/18/127985,biorxiv,2017,0ac7b539-220b-44b0-8d7a-58c02e6b1fa6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/18/127985.full.pdf

It is still unclear, however, what are the main features of those networks that allow a cell to encode and interpret its ever changing environment. Here we address this question by studying the computational capabilities of the transcriptional regulatory networks of five evolutionary distant organisms. We identify in all cases a cyclic recurrent structure, formed by a small core of genes, that is essential for dynamical encoding and information integration. The recent history of the cell is encoded by the transient dynamics of this recurrent reservoir of nodes, while the rest of the network forms a readout layer devoted to decode and interpret the high-dimensional dynamical state of the recurrent core. This separation of roles allows for the integration of temporal information, while facilitating the learning of new environmental conditions and preventing catastrophic interference between those new inputs and the previously stored information. This resembles the reservoir-computing paradigm recently proposed in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Our results reveal that gene regulatory networks act as echo-state networks that perform optimally in standard memory-demanding tasks, and confirms that most of their memory resides in the recurrent reservoir. We also show that the readout layer can learn to decode the information stored in the reservoir via standard evolutionary strategies.

Remarkably, the computational processes underlying sensory prediction during active motion and their relationship to internal model computations established during passive movements remain unknown. Here we construct a Kalman filter that incorporates motor commands into a previously-established model of optimal passive self-motion estimation. We find that the simulated sensory error and feedback signals match experimentally measured neuronal response during active and passive head and trunk rotations and translations. We conclude that a single internal model of head motion can process motor commands and sensory afferent signals optimally, and we describe how previously identified neural responses in the brainstem and cerebellum may represent distinct nodes in these computations.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/132936,biorxiv,2017,a465798c-53dc-48da-98f6-b90bc33faf48,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/132936.full.pdf

Cortical state and natural movie responses in cat visual cortex," View ORCID ProfileMartin A Spacek, Nicholas V Swindale",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"How does cortical state affect neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, and is it analogous between anesthetized and awake animals? We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from all layers of isoflurane-anesthetized cat primary visual cortex (V1) while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses of single units were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, with lognormally distributed mean firing rates. Many units had distinct barcode-like firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Because the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced, our results complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals.

By utilizing aerobic substrate arrays to examine the effect of carbon amendment on microbial communities taken from six distinct environments (soil from a temperate prairie and forest, tropical forest soil, subalpine forest soil, and surface water and soil from a palustrine emergent wetland), we examined how carbon amendment and inoculum source shape the composition of the community in each enrichment. Dilute subsamples from each environment were used to inoculate 96-well microtiter plates containing triplicate wells amended with one of 31 carbon sources from 6 different classes of organic compound (phenols, polymers, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amines, amino acids). After incubating each well aerobically in the dark for 72 hours, we analyzed the composition of the microbial communities on the substrate arrays as well as the initial inocula by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Comparisons of alpha and beta diversity in these systems showed that, while the composition of the communities that grow to inhabit the wells in each substrate array diverges sharply from that of the original community in the inoculum, these enrichment communities are still is strongly affected by the inoculum source. We found most enrichments were dominated by one or several OTUs most closely related to aerobes or facultative anaerobes from the Proteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Ralstonia) or Bacteroidetes (e.g. Chryseobacterium). Comparisons within each substrate array based on the class of carbon source further show that the communities inhabiting wells amended with a carbohydrate differ significantly from those enriched with a phenolic compound. Niche selection therefore seems to play a strong role in shaping the communities in the substrate arrays, although some stochasticity is seen whereby several replicate wells within a single substrate array display strongly divergent community compositions. Overall, the use of highly parallel substrate arrays offers a promising path forward to study the response of microbial communities to a changing environment.","['dion@anl.gov', 'tflynn@anl.gov']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/27/154781,biorxiv,2017,b421cd27-f19b-4ba5-a5d8-4036dc4b357b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/27/154781.full.pdf

For the first time, our findings reveal a comprehensive picture of the global and local dynamics of error-related HGB activity in the human brain. On the global level as reflected in the noninvasive EEG, the error-related response started with an early component dominated by anterior brain regions, followed by a shift to parietal regions, and a subsequent phase characterized by sustained parietal HGB activity. This phase lasted for more than 1 s after the error onset. On the local level as reflected in the intracranial EEG, a cascade of both transient and sustained error-related responses involved an even more extended network, extending beyond frontal and parietal regions to the insula and hippocampus. HGB mapping appeared especially well suited to investigate late, sustained components of the error response, possibly linked to downstream functional stages such as error-related learning and behavioral adaptation.

Many previous studies have demonstrated a coupling of postsynaptic spiking with modification of perisomatic inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors leads to input-specific long-term potentiation of dendritic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This form of plasticity is expressed postsynaptically and requires both CaMKIIα and the β2-subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Importantly, this process may function to preserve dendritic inhibition, as in vivo loss of NMDAR signaling results in a selective weakening of dendritic inhibition.

growing evidence that our behavior is mediated by simultaneous activity of several interacting and

temporal profiles of such interaction are of interest. The existing methods are primarily concerned
with proposing novel measures of synchrony to be applied to the cortical region activity signals
extracted from the MEG data using beamforming or other spatial filtering approaches.

In this work we propose to render the task of estimating network topology and temporal profiles as
a source estimation problem but in the space of interacting topographies. The proposed point of
view has a number of benefits as it allows to use the wealth of techniques and intuition accumulated
in the community when dealing with source estimation problems. Operating in the interacting
topographies space we first propose subspace projection method to significantly reduce the spatial leakage effect in the cross-spectral matrix. We then use subspace matching metrics to extract a set of networks with their synchronicity profiles that explain the variance in the  sensor space cross-spectral matrix,
much like regular dipoles and their activations explain the variance in the regular evoked responses.

The preliminary results of application of this method to a simple self-paced voluntary finger movement paradigm  comparing allowed to observe functional coupling between primary motor and supplementary motor area and establish that this coupling can be characterized with near-zero phase delay between the oscillatory activity of these two regions.

Here, utilizing the large numbers of structures and functional annotations now available, we have investigated how proteins that assemble into different types of homomers are associated with different biological functions. We observe that homomers from different symmetry groups are significantly enriched in distinct functions, and can often provide simple physical and geometrical explanations for these associations in regards to substrate recognition or physical environment. One of the strongest associations is the tendency for metabolic enzymes to form dihedral complexes, which we suggest is closely related to allosteric regulation. We provide a physical explanation for why allostery is related to dihedral complexes: it allows for efficient propagation of conformational changes across isologous (i.e. symmetric) interfaces. Overall we demonstrate a clear relationship between protein function and homomer symmetry that has important implications for understanding protein evolution, as well as for predicting protein function and quaternary structure.",['therese.bergendahl@igmm.ed.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/13/081745,biorxiv,2017,66abd530-a4ef-493f-b18d-1a64fbfe4a0a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/13/081745.full.pdf

Evaluation of machine learning methods to predict peptide binding to MHC Class I proteins,"Rohit Bhattacharya, Ashok Sivakumar, Collin Tokheim, Violeta Beleva Guthrie, Valsamo Anagnostou, Victor E.

Peptides bound to MHCs are recognized by CD8+ (MHC Class I) and CD4+ (MHC Class II) T-cells. Successful prediction of which peptides will bind to specific MHC alleles would benefit many cancer immunotherapy applications. Currently, supervised machine learning is the leading computational approach to predict peptide-MHC binding, and a number of methods, trained using results of binding assays, have been published. Many clinical researchers are dissatisfied with the sensitivity and specificity of currently available methods and the limited number of alleles for which they can be applied. We evaluated several recent methods to predict peptide-MHC Class I binding affinities and a new method of our own design (MHCnuggets). We used a high-quality benchmark set of 51 alleles, which has been applied previously. The neural network methods NetMHC, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, and MHCnuggets achieved similar best-in-class prediction performance in our testing, and of these methods MHCnuggets was significantly faster. MHCnuggets is a gated recurrent neural network, and the only method to our knowledge which can handle peptides of any length, without artificial lengthening and shortening. Seventeen alleles were problematic for all tested methods. Prediction difficulties could be explained by deficiencies in the training and testing examples in the benchmark, suggesting that biological differences in allele-specific binding properties are not as important as previously claimed.

We examined the fidelity with which Symbiodinium communities in the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix are vertically transmitted and the extent to which communities are genetically regulated, by genotyping 60 larvae and their parents (9 maternal and 45 paternal colonies) using high throughput sequencing of the ITS-2 locus. Unexpectedly, Symbiodinium communities associated with brooded larvae were distinct from those within parent colonies, including the presence of types not detected in adults. Bayesian heritability (h2) analysis revealed that 33% of variability in larval Symbiodinium communities was genetically controlled. Results highlight flexibility in the establishment of larval communities and overturn the paradigm that symbiont transmission is exclusively vertical in brooding corals. Instead, we show that Symbiodinium transmission in S. hystrix involves a mixed-mode strategy, similar to many terrestrial invertebrate symbioses. Also, variation in the abundances of common Symbiodinium types among adult communities suggests that microhabitat differences influence the structure of in hospite Symbiodinium communities. Partial genetic regulation coupled with flexibility in the environmentally-acquired component of larval Symbiodinium communities implies that corals with vertical transmission, like S. hystrix, may be more resilient to environmental change than previously thought.","['2AIMS@JCU', 'katemarie.quigley@my.jcu.edu.au']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/173591,biorxiv,2017,13b52225-f689-44fb-818f-b7cc908e80a6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/173591.full.pdf

Near-optimal decoding of transient stimuli from coupled neuronal subpopulations,"James Trousdale, Samuel R. Carroll, Fabrizio Gabbiani, Krešimir Josić",Now published in Journal of Neuroscience. 2014,"Coupling between sensory neurons impacts their tuning properties and correlations in their responses. How such coupling affects sensory representations and ultimately behavior remains unclear. We investigated the role of neuronal coupling during visual processing using a realistic biophysical model of the vertical system (VS) cell network in the blow fly. These neurons are thought to  encode the horizontal rotation axis during rapid free flight manoeuvres. Experimental findings suggest neurons of the vertical system are strongly electrically coupled, and that several downstream neurons driving motor responses to ego-rotation receive inputs primarily from a small subset of VS  cells. These downstream neurons must decode information about the axis of rotation from a partial readout of the VS population response. To investigate the role of coupling, we simulated the VS response to a variety of rotating visual scenes and
computed optimal Bayesian estimates  from the  relevant subset of VS cells. Our analysis shows that coupling leads to near-optimal estimates from a subpopulation readout.
In contrast, coupling between VS cells has no impact on the quality of encoding in the response of the full population. We conclude that coupling at one level of the fly visual system allows for near-optimal decoding from partial information at the subsequent, pre-motor level.

Untuned But Not Irrelevant: A Role For Untuned Neurons In Sensory Information Coding,Joel Zylberberg,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In the sensory systems, most neurons' firing rates are tuned to at least one aspect of the stimulus. Other neurons are untuned, meaning that their firing rates appear not to depend on the stimulus. Previous work on information coding in neural populations has ignored the untuned neurons, based on the tacit assumption that they are unimportant. Recently, me and other researchers have begun to question that assumption. Using theoretical calculations and analyses of iin vivo neural data, I show how untuned neurons contribute to neural information coding. Ignoring untuned neurons can lead to severe underestimates of the amount of stimulus information encoded, and in some cases population codes can be made more informative by replacing tuned neurons with untuned ones.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/29/134379,biorxiv,2017,71750062-c7e0-41c1-a886-9ca66b5ff7bb,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/29/134379.full.pdf

Multidimensional spatio-temporal biological data sets such as time series gene expression with various perturbations with different cell lines, or neural spike data sets across many experimental trials have the potential to acquire insight across multiple dimensions. For this potential to be realized, we need a suitable representation to turn data into insight. 
Since a wide range of experiments and the (unknown) complexity of underlying system make biological data more heterogeneous than those in other fields, we propose the method based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which is well suited for extracting principal components where we have corrupted observations. The proposed method provides us a new representation of these data sets which consists of its common and aberrant response. This representation might help users to acquire a new insight from data. %For example, identifying common event-related neural features across many experimental trials can be used as a signature to detect discrete events or state transitions.

This spatially periodic firing pattern was originally considered to be invariant to the geometric properties of the environment. However, this notion was contested by examining the grid cell periodicity in environments with different polarity (Krupic et al 2015) and in connected environments (Carpenter et al 2015). Aforementioned experimental results demonstrated the dependence of grid cell activity on environmental geometry. Analysis of grid cell periodicity on practically infinite variations of environmental geometry imposes a limitation on the experimental study. Hence we analyze the grid cell periodicity from a computational point of view using a model that was successful in generating a wide range of spatial cells, including grid cells, place cells, head direction cells and border cells. We simulated the model in four types of environmental geometries such as: 1) connected environments, 2) convex shapes, 3) concave shapes and 4) regular polygons with varying number of sides. Simulation results point to a greater function for grid cells than what was believed hitherto. Grid cells in the model code not just for local position but also for more global information like the shape of the environment.

Cross-species transmission and differential fate of an endogenous retrovirus in three mammal lineages," View ORCID ProfileXiaoyu Zhuo, Cedric Feschotte",Now published in PLOS Pathogens. 2015,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) arise from retroviruses chromosomally integrated in the host germline. ERVs are common in vertebrate genomes and provide a valuable fossil record of past retroviral infections to investigate the biology and evolution of retroviruses over a deep time scale, including cross-species transmission events. Here we took advantage of a catalog of ERVs we recently produced for the bat Myotis lucifugus to seek evidence for infiltration of these retroviruses in other mammalian species (>100) currently represented in the genome sequence database. We provide multiple lines of evidence for the cross-ordinal transmission of a gammaretrovirus endogenized independently in the lineages of vespertilionid bats, felid cats and pangolin ~13-25 million years ago. Following its initial introduction, the ERV amplified extensively in parallel in both bat and cat lineages, generating hundreds of species-specific insertions throughout evolution. However, despite being derived from the same viral species, phylogenetic and selection analyses suggest that the ERV experienced different amplification dynamics in the two mammalian lineages. In the cat lineage, the ERV appears to have expanded primarily by retrotransposition of a single proviral progenitor that lost infectious capacity shortly after endogenization. In the bat lineage, the ERV followed a more complex path of germline invasion characterized by both retrotransposition and multiple infection events. The results also suggest that some of the bat ERVs have maintained infectious capacity for extended period of time and may be still infectious today. This study provides one of the most rigorously documented cases of cross-ordinal transmission of a mammalian retrovirus. It also illustrates how the same retrovirus species has transitioned multiple times from an infectious pathogen to a genomic parasite (i.e. retrotransposon), yet experiencing different invasion dynamics in different mammalian hosts.",['cedric@genetics.utah.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/10/024190,biorxiv,2015,6c9ac9ed-5c80-4ef3-be9c-99939d597eca,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/10/024190.full.pdf

We hypothesize that sparse and weak synaptic connectivity between Hebbian assemblies are boosted by pre-existing recurrent connectivity within them. To investigate this idea, we connect sequences of assemblies in randomly connected spiking neuronal networks with a balance of excitation and inhibition. Simulations and analytical calculations show that recurrent connections within assemblies allow for a fast amplification of signals that indeed reduces the required number of inter-assembly connections.

Recent studies have identified a large number of  genetic variants  associated with  variation in RNA processing that also have an important role in complex traits; yet we do not know in which contexts the different underlying isoforms are used. Here, we comprehensively characterized  changes in RNA processing events across 89 environments in five human cell types and identified 15,300 event shifts (FDR = 15%) comprised of eight event types in over 4,000 genes. Many of these changes occur consistently in the same direction across conditions, indicative of global regulation by trans factors. Accordingly, we demonstrate that environmental modulation of splicing factor binding predicts shifts in intron retention, and that binding of transcription factors predicts shifts in AFE usage in response to specific treatments. We validated the mechanism hypothesized for AFE in two independent datasets. Using ATAC-seq, we found altered binding of 64 factors in response to selenium at sites of AFE shift, including ELF2 and other factors in the ETS family. We also performed AFE QTL mapping in 373 individuals and found an enrichment for SNPs predicted to disrupt binding of the ELF2 factor.

Spatial Structure Of Synchronized Inhibition In The Olfactory Bulb,"Hannah A Arnson, Ben Strowbridge",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Olfactory sensory input is detected by receptor neurons in the nose which then send information to the olfactory bulb, the first brain region for processing olfactory information. Within the olfactory bulb, many local circuit interneurons, including axonless granule cells, function to facilitate fine odor discrimination. How interneurons interact with principal cells to affect bulbar processing is not known though the mechanism is likely to be different than in sensory cortical regions since the olfactory bulb lacks an obvious topographical organization; neighboring glomerular columns, representing inputs from different receptor neuron subtypes, typically have different odor tuning. Determining the spatial scale over which interneurons such as granule cells can affect principal cells is a critical step towards understanding how the olfactory bulb operates. We addressed this question by assaying inhibitory synchrony using intracellular recordings from pairs of principal cells with different inter-somatic spacing. We find that in acute rat olfactory bulb slices, inhibitory synchrony is evident in the spontaneous synaptic input in mitral cells separated up to 300 μm. At all inter-somatic spacing assayed, inhibitory synchrony was dependent on fast Na+ channels, suggesting that action potentials in granule cells function to coordinate GABA release at relatively distant dendrodendritic synapses formed throughout the the dendritic arbor. Our results suggest that individual granule cells are able to influence relatively large groups of mitral and tufted cells belonging to clusters of at least 15 glomerular modules, providing a potential mechanism to integrate signals reflecting a wide variety of odorants.",['bens@case.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/03/123695,biorxiv,2017,2ddcd169-734d-4efc-beaf-5dc1b02db9bc,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/03/123695.full.pdf
Causal role of beta oscillations in time estimation," View ORCID ProfileMartin Wiener, Alomi Parikh, Arielle Krakow, H Branch Coslett",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The neural mechanisms underlying time perception are of vital importance to a comprehensive understanding of behavior and cognition.  Recent work has pointed to a supramodal role for beta oscillations in coordinating endogenous timing mechanisms for the purpose of measuring temporal intervals.  However, the majority of this work has employed paradigms relying on timed motor processing.  Further, if beta oscillations are crucial for timing, alteration of beta oscillations would be expected to influence performance on timing tasks; this prediction has not been tested.  Here, we address these issues and demonstrate for the first time a causal connection between beta oscillations and timing.  To accomplish this, we first re-analyzed two, separate EEG datasets from psychophysical experiments demonstrating that beta oscillations are associated with the retention and comparison of a memory standard for duration, and that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right supramarginal gyrus leads to an icnrease in midline beta power during the encoding of a temporal interval, corresponding with a longer perceived interval of time.  Next, we conducted a study of 20 healthy human participants using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), over frontocentral cortex, at alpha (10hz) and beta (20hz) frequencies, during a visual temporal bisection task; we found that beta stimulation exclusively shifts the perception of time such that stimuli are reported as longer in duration, while preserving precision.  Finally, we decomposed trial-by-trial choice data with a drift diffusion model of decision making and temporal encoding that reveals that the shift in timing is caused by a change in the starting point of accumulation, rather than the drift rate or threshold.  Our results provide causal evidence for the involvement of beta oscillations in the perception of time, and point to a specific role for beta oscillations in the encoding and retention of memory for temporal intervals.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/19/165233,biorxiv,2017,33813637-c87d-4de5-af53-55886a414555,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/19/165233.full.pdf

Characterizing RNA Pseudouridylation By Convolutional Neural Networks,"Xuan He, Sai Zhang, Yanqing Zhang, Tao Jiang, Jianyang Zeng",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The most prevalent post-transcriptional RNA modification, pseudouridine (Ψ), also known as the fifth ribonucleoside, is widespread in rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and mRNAs. Pseudouridines in RNAs are implicated in many aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, such as the maintenance of translation fidelity, control of RNA stability and stabilization of RNA structure. However, our understanding of the functions, mechanisms as well as precise distribution of pseudourdines (especially in mRNAs) still remains largely unclear. Though thousands of RNA pseudouridylation sites have been identified by high-throughput experimental techniques recently, the landscape of pseudouridines across the whole transcriptome has not yet been fully delineated. In this study, we present a highly effective model, called PULSE (PseudoUridyLation Sites Estimator), to predict novel Ψ sites from large-scale profiling data of pseudouridines and characterize the contextual sequence features of pseudouridylation. PULSE employs a deep learning framework, called convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been successfully and widely used for sequence pattern discovery in the literature. Our extensive validation tests demonstrated that PULSE can outperform conventional learning models and achieve high prediction accuracy, thus enabling us to further characterize the transcriptome-wide landscape of pseudouridine sites.

Distinct projection patterns of different classes of layer 2 principal neurons in the olfactory cortex,"Camille Mazo, Julien Grimaud, Venkatesh N Murthy,  View ORCID ProfileC. Geoffrey Lau",Now published in Scientific Reports. 2017,"Processing of olfactory information in the anterior piriform cortex (APC) is widely thought to be non-topographic due to distributed projections from the olfactory bulb (OB). Layer 2 principal neurons in the APC can be divided into 2 subtypes: semilunar (SL) and superficial pyramidal (SP) cells. Although it is known that SL and SP cells receive differential inputs from the OB, little is known about their projection pattern to downstream structures, such as the posterior piriform cortex (PPC). Here we examined feedforward and feedback axonal projections of SL and SP cells using a combination of mouse genetics, and retrograde labeling. Retrograde tracing from the OB or PPC showed that the APC projects to these higher and lower brain regions mainly through layer 2b cells, while dual-labeling revealed a sizeable fraction of cells extending collaterals to both target regions. Furthermore, a transgenic mouse line specifically labeling SL cells showed that they send profuse axonal projections to olfactory cortical areas, but not to the OB. These findings support a model in which information flow from SL to SP cells and back to the OB forms a hierarchical feedback circuit whereas the two cell types process recurrent and feedforward information in a parallel manner.","['vnmurthy@fas.harvard.edu.', 'geoff.lau@cityu.edu.hk.']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/02/113134,biorxiv,2017,58243aa1-4fb5-4620-9f25-df642d292cfd,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/02/113134.full.pdf

Distinct Cellular States Determine Calcium Signaling Response,"Jason Yao, Roy Wollman",Now published in Molecular Systems Biology. 2016,"The heterogeneity in mammalian cells signaling response is largely a result of preexisting cell-to-cell variability. It is unknown whether cell-to-cell variability rises from biochemical stochastic fluctuations or distinct cellular states. Here we utilize calcium response to ATP as a model for investigating the structure of heterogeneity within a population of cells and analyze whether distinct cellular response states co-exist. We use a functional definition of cellular state that is based on a mechanistic dynamical systems model of calcium signaling. Using Bayesian parameter inference we obtain high confidence parameter value distributions for several hundred cells, each fitted individually. Clustering the inferred parameter distributions revealed three major distinct cellular states within the population. The existence of distinct cellular states raises the possibility that the observed variability in response is a result of structured heterogeneity between cells.

Multi-Region Neural Representation: A novel model for decoding visual stimuli in human brains,"Muhammad Yousefnezhad,  View ORCID ProfileDaoqiang Zhang",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification holds enormous potential for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e. decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs), visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series. Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies.

IVT-seq reveals extreme bias in RNA-sequencing,"Nicholas F Lahens, Ibrahim Halil Kavakli, Ray Zhang, Katharina Hayer, Michael B Black, Hannah Dueck, Angel Pizarro, Junhyong Kim, Rafael A Irizarry, Russell S Thomas, Gregory R Grant, John B Hogenesch",Now published in Genome Biology. 2014,"Background
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.

Results
Here we present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of > 1000 in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with poly-A and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length and we show IVT is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find ~50% of transcripts have > 2-fold and ~10% have > 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. Strikingly, we also find > 6% of transcripts have regions of high, unpredictable sequencing coverage, where the same transcript varies dramatically in coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. To get at causal factors, we used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show that rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage and that several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.

Conclusions
In sum, these results show the utility of IVT-seq in promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq and suggest caution in its interpretation. Furthermore, we find that rRNA-depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage. Perhaps most importantly, these coverage biases introduced during library preparation suggest exon level expression analysis may be inadvisable.","['nif@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'hkavakli@ku.edu.tr', 'rayzhang@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'hayer@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'MBlack@thehamner.org', 'hdueck@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'pizarroa@amazon.com', 'junhyong@sas.upenn.edu', 'rafa@jhu.edu', 'RThomas@thehamner.org', 'ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu', 'hogenesc@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'hogenesc@mail.med.upenn.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/05/21/005371,biorxiv,2014,c3679da1-7516-48b4-95c6-0863879fd60c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/05/21/005371.full.pdf
Towards a new history and geography of human genes informed by ancient DNA,"Joseph Pickrell, David Reich",Now published in Trends in Genetics. 2014,"Genetic information contains a record of the history of our species, and technological advances have transformed our ability to access this record. Many studies have used genome-wide data from populations today to learn about the peopling of the globe and subsequent adaptation to local conditions. Implicit in this research is the assumption that the geographic locations of people today are informative about the geographic locations of their ancestors in the distant past. However, it is now clear that long-range migration, admixture and population replacement have been the rule rather than the exception in human history. In light of this, we argue that it is time to critically re-evaluate current views of the peopling of the globe and the importance of natural selection in determining the geographic distribution of phenotypes.

Odor responses in GCs were temporally diverse and spatially disperse, with some degree of non-random, modular organization. The overall sparseness of activation of GCs was highly correlated with the extent of glomerular activation by odor stimuli. Increasing concentrations of single odorants led to proportionately larger population activity, but some individual GCs had non-monotonic relation to concentration due to local inhibitory interactions. Individual dendritic segments could sometimes respond independently to odors, revealing their capacity for compartmentalized signaling in vivo.

For instance, at the end of the Quaternary glaciations in Europe, secondary contact occurred during the northward expansion of the populations which had found refugia in the southern peninsulas. With the advent of multi-locus markers, secondary contact can be investigated using various molecular signatures including gradients of allele frequency, admixture clines, and local increase of genetic differentiation. We use coalescent simulations to investigate if molecular data provide enough information to distinguish between secondary contact following range expansion and an alternative evolutionary scenario consisting of a barrier to gene flow in an isolation-by-distance model. Although evidence for secondary contact is usually conveyed by statistics related to admixture coefficients, we find that they have no power to make the distinction. By contrast, the directionality index ψ that was proposed to study range expansion is informative.

Silencing Of Transposable Elements May Not Be A Major Driver Of Regulatory Evolution In Primate Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Michelle C. Ward, Siming Zhao, Kaixuan Luo, Bryan J. Pavlovic, Mohammad M. Karimi, Matthew Stephens, Yoav Gilad",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a substantial proportion of primate genomes. The regulatory potential of TEs can result in deleterious effects, especially during development. It has been suggested that, in pluripotent stem cells, TEs are targeted for silencing by KRAB-ZNF proteins, which recruit the TRIM28-SETDB1 complex, to deposit the repressive histone modification H3K9me3. TEs, in turn, can acquire mutations that allow them to evade detection by the host, and hence KRAB-ZNF proteins need to rapidly evolve to counteract them. To investigate the short-term evolution of TE silencing, we profiled the genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3 in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K9me3, as well as total RNA sequencing. We focused specifically on cross-species H3K9me3 ChIP-seq data that mapped to four million orthologous TEs. We found that, depending on the TE class, 10-60% of elements are marked by H3K9me3, with SVA, LTR and LINE elements marked most frequently. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 80% of orthologous, putatively silenced, TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across six million years of primate evolution. Interestingly, the minority of TEs enriched for H3K9me3 in one species are not more likely to be associated with gene expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes.

Local context influences memory for emotional stimuli but not electrophysiological markers of emotion-dependent attention,"Gemma E Barnacle, Dimitris Tsivilis,  View ORCID ProfileAlexandre Schaefer, Deborah Talmi",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Emotional Enhancement of free recall can be context dependent. It is readily observed when emotional and neutral scenes are encoded and recalled together, in a ""mixed"" list, but diminishes when these scenes are encoded separately, in ""pure"" lists. We examined the hypothesis that this effect is due to differences of allocation of attention to neutral stimuli according to whether they are presented in mixed or pure lists, especially when encoding is intentional. Using picture stimuli that were controlled for semantic relatedness, our results contradicted this hypothesis. The amplitude of well-known electrophysiological markers of emotion-related attention, the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), the Late Positive Potential (LPP), and the Slow Wave (SW), was higher for emotional stimuli. Crucially, the emotional modulation of these ERPs was insensitive to list context, observed equally in pure and mixed lists. Although list context did not modulate neural markers of emotion-related attention, list context did modulate the effect of emotion on free recall. The apparent decoupling of the emotional effects on attention and memory challenges existing hypotheses accounting for the emotional enhancement of memory. We close by discussing whether findings are more compatible with an alternative hypothesis, where the magnitude of emotional memory enhancement is, at least in part, a consequence of retrieval dynamics.","['deborah.talmi@manchester.ac.uk', 'deborah.talmi@manchester.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/04/184309,biorxiv,2017,533adcc4-5f76-4b3e-87ec-d802fdeadb52,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/04/184309.full.pdf

The SCB captures variable importance by analyzing the sign consistency of the corresponding weights in an ensemble of linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Further, the SCB variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. This extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. Finally, the proposal of these SCB variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance.

Understanding sequence conservation with deep learning,"Yi Li, Daniel Quang, Xiaohui Xie",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Motivation: Comparing the human genome to the genomes of closely related mammalian species has been a powerful tool for discovering functional elements in the human genome. Millions of conserved elements have been discovered. However, understanding the functional roles of these elements still remain a challenge, especially in noncoding regions. In particular, it is still unclear why these elements are evolutionarily conserved and what kind of functional elements are encoded within these sequences.  Results: We present a deep learning framework, called DeepCons, to uncover potential functional elements within conserved sequences. DeepCons is a convolutional neural net (CNN) that receives a short segment of DNA sequence as input and outputs the probability of the sequence of being evolutionary conserved. DeepCons utilizes hundreds of convolution kernels to detect features within DNA sequences, and automatically learns these kernels after training the CNN model using 887,577 conserved elements and a similar number of nonconserved elements in the human genome. On a balanced test dataset, DeepCons can achieve an accuracy of 75% in determining whether a sequence element is conserved or not, and the area under the ROC curve of 0.83, based on information from the human genome alone. We further investigate the properties of the learned kernels. Some kernels are directly related to well-known regulatory motifs corresponding to transcription factors. Many kernels show positional biases relative to transcriptional start sites or transcription end sites. But most of discovered kernels do not correspond to any known functional element, suggesting that they might represent unknown categories of functional elements. We also utilize DeepCons to annotate how changes at each individual nucleotide might impact the conservation properties of the surrounding sequences.

Parallel Occurrence Of Theta And Respiration-Coupled Network Oscillations Throughout The Mouse Brain,"Adriano B. L. Tort, Simon Ponsel, Jakob Jessberger, Yevgenij Yanovsky, Jurij Brankačk, Andreas Draguhn",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Slow brain oscillations are usually coherent over long distances and are thought to constitute a means to link distributed cell assemblies. In mice, theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) stand as one of the most studied global slow rhythms. Previous research has suggested that theta takes part in interregional communication required for cognitive functions. However, mice often breathe at theta frequency, and we have recently reported that nasal respiration leads to synchronous network oscillations that are independent of theta. Namely, we showed that respiration-coupled oscillations occur in the hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and parietal cortex, suggesting that, as theta, respiration-coupled oscillations are also global. In the present work, we sought to extend these findings by tracking respiration while simultaneously recording local field potentials from 15 brain regions of freely moving mice during exploration and REM sleep. We report that respiration-coupled rhythms can be detected in parallel with theta in widespread neocortical regions, from prefrontal to visual areas, and also in subcortical structures such as the thalamus, amygdala and ventral hippocampus. Though both rhythms occur simultaneously, respiration-coupled oscillations are more dominant in frontal regions while theta oscillations prevail in more caudal networks. We conclude that respiration-coupled oscillations are a global brain rhythm suited to entrain distributed networks into a common regime. This pattern might have escaped attention in previous studies due to the absence of respiration monitoring, its similarity with theta oscillations, and its highly variable peak frequency. It should, however, be considered as a widespread signal and potential mechanism of long-range network communication.",['jurij.brankack@physiologie.uni-heidelberg.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139485,biorxiv,2017,962e08f2-56ba-427e-a51b-4cd3881e0cbc,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139485.full.pdf

"Measuring changes in transmission of neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and enteric pathogens from quantitative antibody levels","Benjamin Arnold, Mark J van der Laan, Alan E Hubbard, Cathy Steel, Joseph Kubofcik, Katy L Hamlin, Delynn M Moss, Thomas B Nutman, Jeffrey W Priest, Patrick J Lammie",Now published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. 2017,"Background: Serological antibody levels are a sensitive marker of pathogen exposure, and advances in multiplex assays have created enormous potential for large-scale, integrated infectious disease surveillance. Most methods to analyze antibody measurements reduce quantitative antibody levels to seropositive and seronegative groups, but this can be difficult for many pathogens and may provide lower resolution information than quantitative levels in low transmission settings. Analysis methods have predominantly maintained a single disease focus, yet integrated surveillance platforms would benefit from methodologies that work across diverse pathogens included in multiplex assays.

Methods/Principal Findings: We developed an approach to measure changes in transmission from quantitative antibody levels that can be applied to diverse pathogens of global importance. We compared age-dependent immunoglobulin G curves in repeated cross-sectional surveys between populations with differences in transmission for multiple pathogens, including: lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) measured before and after mass drug administration on Mauke, Cook Islands, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) before and after a combined insecticide and mass drug administration intervention in the Garki project, Nigeria, and enteric protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica), bacteria (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), and viruses (norovirus groups I and II) in children living in Haiti and the USA. Age-dependent antibody curves fit with ensemble machine learning followed a characteristic shape across pathogens that aligned with predictions from basic mechanisms of humoral immunity. Differences in pathogen transmission led to shifts in fitted antibody curves that were remarkably consistent across pathogens, assays, and populations. Mean antibody levels correlated strongly with traditional measures of transmission intensity, such as the entomological inoculation rate for P. falciparum (Spearman's rho=0.75). Seroprevalence estimates recapitulated patterns observed in quantitative antibody levels, albeit with lower resolution.

Conclusions/Significance: Age-dependent antibody curves and summary means provided a robust and sensitive measure of changes in transmission, with greatest sensitivity among young children. The method generalizes to pathogens that can be measured in high-throughput, multiplex serological assays, and scales to surveillance activities that require high spatiotemporal resolution. The approach represents a new opportunity to conduct integrated serological surveillance for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and other infectious diseases with well-defined antigen targets.",['benarnold@berkeley.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/07/106708,biorxiv,2017,d9551b37-d0a0-4313-ab0b-3abeccc0deed,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/07/106708.full.pdf

To this purpose, we estimated voxels' spatial sampling in 5 human subjects under conditions of differential spatial and feature-based attention. Specifically, participants either performed a task at fixation, or on the color or temporal frequency content of a visual stimulus. We also recorded each voxel's relative response modulation to changes in color and temporal frequency information. Directing spatial attention towards the mapping stimulus altered population receptive field (pRF) size and eccentricity in concert. This resampling of visual space was more pronounced when attending the stimulus' color compared to temporal frequency content throughout the visual system. This effect was best modeled using an attention field model in which the attention field spread was similar across all visual field maps, and smaller when attending the stimulus' color. In higher visual cortex these changes optimized feature sampling for task demands by alleviating a relatively low preference for color in the periphery.

Importance 
Bipolar disorder (BD) overlaps schizophrenia in its clinical presentation and genetic liability. Alternative approaches to patient stratification beyond current diagnostic categories are needed to understand the underlying disease processes/mechanisms.
Objectives
To investigate the relationship between common-variant liability for schizophrenia, indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) and psychotic presentations of BD, using clinical descriptions which consider both occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic features.
Design
Case-control design: using multinomial logistic regression, to estimate differential associations of PRS across categories of cases and controls.
Settings & Participants 
4399 BDcases, mean [sd] age-at-interview 46[12] years, of which 2966 were woman (67%) from the BD Research Network (BDRN) were included in the final analyses, with data for 4976 schizophrenia cases and 9012 controls from the Type-1 diabetes genetics consortium and Generation Scotland included for comparison.
Exposure
Standardised PRS, calculated using alleles with an association p-value threshold < 0.05 in the second Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, adjusted for the first 10 population principal components and genotyping-platform. 
Main outcome measure
Multinomial logit models estimated PRS associations with BD stratified by (1) Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) BD subtypes (2) Lifetime occurrence of psychosis.(3) Lifetime mood-incongruent psychotic features and (4) ordinal logistic regression examined PRS associations across levels of mood-incongruence. Ratings were derived from the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry interview (SCAN) and the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale (BADDS). 
Results 
Across clinical phenotypes, there was an exposure-response gradient with the strongest PRS association for schizophrenia (RR=1.94, (95% C.I. 1.86, 2.01)), then schizoaffective BD (RR=1.37, (95% C.I. 1.22, 1.54)), BD I (RR= 1.30, (95% C.I. 1.24, 1.36)) and BD II (RR=1.04, (95% C.I. 0.97, 1.11)). Within BD cases, there was an effect gradient, indexed by the nature of psychosis, with prominent mood-incongruent psychotic features having the strongest association (RR=1.46, (95% C.I. 1.36, 1.57)), followed by mood-congruent psychosis (RR= 1.24, (95% C.I. 1.17, 1.33)) and lastly, BD cases with no history of psychosis (RR=1.09, (95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15)).

Here we investigated whether SEZ progenitors can be programmed towards glutamatergic neurogenesis through forced expression of Neurog2. Retrovirus-mediated expression of Neurog2 induced the glutamatergic neuron lineage markers Tbr2 and Tbr1 in cultured SEZ progenitors which subsequently differentiated into functional glutamatergic neurons. Likewise, retrovirus-mediated expression of Neurog2 in dividing SEZ progenitors within the adult SEZ induced Tbr2 and Tbr1 expression, hallmarking entry into the glutamatergic lineage also in vivo. Intriguingly, Neurog2-expressing progenitors failed to enter the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and instead differentiated directly within the SEZ or the adjacent striatum. In sharp contrast, lentivirus-mediated postmitotic expression of Neurog2 failed to reprogram early SEZ neurons, which instead maintained their GABAergic identity and migrated along the RMS towards the olfactory bulb. Thus, our data show that Neurog2 can program SEZ progenitors towards a glutamatergic identity, but fails to reprogram their postmitotic progeny.","['berningb@uni-mainz.de', 'sergio.gascon@med.uni-muenchen.de']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/03/171686,biorxiv,2017,7141919c-09ff-435b-88f3-c4cdc47e2b64,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/03/171686.full.pdf

Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science, we propose that this is achieved by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks.

Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity.

Automated 3D Neuron Tracing with Precise Branch Erasing and Confidence Controlled Back-Tracking,"Siqi Liu, Donghao Zhang, Yang Song, Hanchuan Peng, Weidong Cai",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Motivation: The automatic reconstruction of single neuron cells is essential to enable large-scale data-driven investigations in computational neuroscience. However, few previous methods were able to generate satisfactory results automatically from 3D microscopic images without human intervention.

Results: We developed a new algorithm for automatic 3D neuron reconstruction. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively track backwards from the potential neuronal termini to the soma centre. The traced areas are labelled to avoid duplicated tracing. An online confidence score is computed to decide if a tracing iteration should be stopped and discarded from the final reconstruction. The performance improvements comparing to the previous methods are mainly introduced by a more accurate estimation of the traced area and a novel confidence controlled back-tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports large-scale batch-processing by requiring only a background threshold. We bench-tested the proposed algorithm on the datasets of the BigNeuron project. We show it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods regarding the reconstruction accuracy. It was also able to generate topologically acceptable neuronal models in a majority of cases without human intervention.

Here, we use a waveform analysis to examine PAC in the human cortex as participants with intracranial electrodes performed a paired associates memory task. We found that successful memory formation exhibited significant decreases in left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortical PAC, and these two regions exhibited changes in PAC within different frequency bands. Two underlying neural mechanisms, nested oscillations and sharp waveforms, were responsible for the changes in these regions.

We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from the ferret temporo-parieto-occipital cortex under various levels of isoflurane and determined the functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalizing the functional connectivity patterns showed that the topographical structure remained similar across depths of anesthesia, resembling the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.",['f.pieper@uke.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/21/070524,biorxiv,2016,0afd5888-9171-4205-beb7-f606ebb5c8f8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/21/070524.full.pdf

On average, young people outperformed their older counterparts during semantic tasks. Overall, both age groups activated similar left-lateralised regions. However, older adults displayed less activation than young people in some elements of the typical left-hemisphere semantic network, including inferior prefrontal, posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. They also showed greater activation in right frontal and parietal regions, particularly those held to be involved in domain-general controlled processing, and principally when they performed more poorly than the young.

To a great extent, our highly-skilled motor responses are a result of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal cord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively fine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on that interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC) architecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme, in which a feed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback controller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger reactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current of forthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we derive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an eligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our eligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it convolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context of cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses should generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being controlled.

Rolling the Dice Twice: Evolving Reconstructed Ancient Proteins in Extant Organisms,Betul Kacar,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2015,"Scientists have access to artifacts of evolutionary history (namely, the fossil record and genomic sequences of living organisms) but they have limited means with which to infer the exact evolutionary events that occurred to produce today s living world. An intriguing question to arise from this historical limitation is whether the evolutionary paths of organisms are dominated by internal or external controlled processes (i.e., Life as a factory) or whether they are inherently random and subject to completely different outcomes if repeated under identical conditions (i.e., Life as a casino parlor). Two experimental approaches, ancestral sequence reconstruction and experimental evolution with microorganisms, can be used to recapitulate ancient adaptive pathways and provide valuable insights into the mutational steps that constitute an organism s genetic heritage. Ancestral sequence reconstruction follows a backwards-from-present-day strategy in which various ancestral forms of a modern gene or protein are reconstructed and then studied mechanistically.

Bayesian Markov models consistently outperform PWMs at predicting motifs in nucleotide sequences,"Matthias Siebert,  View ORCID ProfileJohannes Soeding",Now published in Nucleic Acids Research. 2016,"Position weight matrices (PWMs) are the standard model for DNA and RNA regulatory motifs. In PWMs nucleotide probabilities are independent of nucleotides at other positions. Models that account for dependencies need many parameters and are prone to overfitting. We have developed a Bayesian approach for motif discovery using Markov models in which conditional probabilities of order k−1 act as priors for those of order k. This Bayesian Markov model (BMM) training automatically adapts model complexity to the amount of available data. We also derive an EM algorithm for de-novo discovery of enriched motifs. For transcription factor binding, BMMs achieve significantly (p < 0.063) higher cross-validated partial AUC than PWMs in 97% of 446 ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and improve performance by 36% on average. BMMs also learn complex multipartite motifs, improving predictions of transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, bacterial pause sites, and RNA binding sites by 26% − 101%.

Dependent Components Analysis (DCA) is a novel approach designed to extract both cortical networks and their dependency structure. DCA is fundamentally different from prevalent data driven approaches, i.e. spatial ICA, in that instead of maximizing the independence of components it optimizes their dependency (in a tree graph structure, tDCA) depicting cortical areas as part of multiple cortical networks. Here tDCA was shown to reliably detect large scale functional networks in single subjects and in group analysis, by clustering non-noisy components on one branch of the tree structure. We used tDCA in three fMRI experiments in which identical auditory and visual stimuli were presented, but novelty information and task relevance were modified. tDCA components tended to include two anticorrelated networks, which were detected in two separate ICA components, or belonged in one component in seed functional connectivity. Although sensory components remained the same across experiments, other components changed as a function of the experimental conditions.  These changes were either within component, where it encompassed other cortical areas, or between components, where the pattern of anticorrelated networks and their statistical dependency changed. Thus tDCA may prove to be a useful, robust tool that provides a rich description of the statistical structure underlying brain activity and its relationships to changes in experimental conditions.

Prediction of RNA-protein sequence and structure binding preferences using deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks,"Xiaoyong Pan, Peter Rijnbeek, Junchi Yan, Hong-Bin Shen",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, which is known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized, especially on the structure point of view. Informative signals hiding and interdependencies between sequence and structure specificities are two challenging problems for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate  sequence and structure motifs mining. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, which are appropriate for subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observations, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract motif features. Considering the close relationship between sequences and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture the long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets, and the results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage is that iDeepS is able to automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our transparent understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.","['shen@sjtu.edu.cn', 'xypan172436@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/07/146175,biorxiv,2017,f040819d-b1ab-4f14-9f94-de8249d3b611,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/07/146175.full.pdf

These 5'UTR introns are not randomly distributed: genes that encode secreted, membrane-bound and mitochondrial proteins are less likely to have them.  Curiously, transcripts lacking 5'UTR introns tend to harbor specific RNA sequence elements in their early coding regions. To model and understand the connection between coding-region sequence and 5'UTR intron status, we developed a classifier that can predict 5'UTR intron status with >80% accuracy using only sequence features in the early coding region. Thus, the classifier identifies transcripts with 5' proximal-intron-minus-like-coding regions (""5IM"" transcripts). Unexpectedly, we found that the early coding sequence features defining 5IM transcripts are widespread, appearing in 21% of all human RefSeq transcripts. The 5IM class of transcripts is enriched for non-AUG start codons, more extensive secondary structure both preceding the start codon and near the 5' cap, greater dependence on eIF4E for translation, and association with ER-proximal ribosomes. 5IM transcripts are bound by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) at non-canonical 5' proximal positions. Finally, N1-methyladenosines are specifically enriched in the early coding regions of 5IM transcripts. Taken together, our analyses point to the existence of a distinct 5IM class comprising ~20% of human transcripts.  This class is defined by depletion of 5' proximal introns, presence of specific RNA sequence features associated with low translation efficiency, N1-methyladenosines in the early coding region, and enrichment for non-canonical binding by the Exon Junction Complex.","['Melissa.Moore@umassmed.edu', 'Fritz.Roth@utoronto.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/06/057455,biorxiv,2016,3ace06a2-38fb-494c-9c8f-de3080b723f6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/06/057455.full.pdf

We find that UP and DOWN periods are variable (i.e. non-rhythmic) and that the population rate shows no significant decay during UP periods. We build a network model of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that exhibits a new bistability between a quiescent state and a balanced state of arbitrarily low rate. Fluctuating inputs trigger state transitions. Adaptation in E cells paradoxically causes a marginal decay of E-rate but a marked decay of I-rate, a signature of balanced bistability that we validate experimentally.

Evolutionary determinants of morphological polymorphism in colonial animals,"Carl Simpson, Jeremy B.C. Jackson, Amalia Herrera-Cubilla",Now published in The American Naturalist. 2016,"Colonial animals commonly exhibit morphologically polymorphic modular units that are phenotypically distinct and specialize in specific functional tasks. But how and why these polymorphic modules have evolved is poorly understood. Across colonial invertebrates there is wide variation in the degree of polymorphism from none in colonial ascidians, to extreme polymorphism in siphonophores such as the Portuguese Man of War. Bryozoa are a phylum of exclusively colonial invertebrates that uniquely exhibit almost the entire range of polymorphism from monomorphic species to others that rival siphonophores in their polymorphic complexity. Previous approaches to understanding the evolution of polymorphism have been based upon analyses of (1) the functional role of polymorphs or (2) presumed evolutionary costs and benefits based upon evolutionary theory that postulates polymorphism should only be evolutionarily sustainable in more ""stable"" environments because polymorphism commonly leads to the loss of feeding and sexual competence. Here we use bryozoans from opposite shores of the Isthmus of Panama to revisit the environmental hypothesis by comparison of faunas from distinct oceanographic provinces that differ greatly in environmental variability and we then examine the correlations between the extent of polymorphism in relation to patterns of ecological succession and variation in life histories. We find no support for the environmental hypothesis. Distributions of the incidence of polymorphism in the oceanographically unstable Eastern Pacific are indistinguishable from those in the more stable Caribbean. In contrast, the temporal position of species in a successional sequence is collinear with the degree of polymorphism because species with fewer types of polymorphs are competitively replaced by species with higher numbers of polymorphs on the same substrata. Competitively dominant species also exhibit patterns of growth that increase their competitive ability. The association between degrees of polymorphism and variations in life histories is fundamental to understanding of the macroevolution of polymorphism.",['carlsimpson.macro@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/27/046409,biorxiv,2016,460cd134-6793-4c4e-b649-6e3c09cc0f30,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/27/046409.full.pdf

In the present work, we propose an unbiased and logically natural approach to transcription factor enrichment. It involves overlaying a list of experimentally determined differentially expressed genes on a background regulatory network coming from e.g. literature curation or computational motif scanning, and identifying that subset of regulators whose aggregated target set best discriminates between the altered and the unaffected genes. In other words, our methodology entails testing of all possible regulatory subnetworks, rather than just the target sets of individual regulators as is followed in most standard approaches.

Recent theoretical investigations indicate that these cells interactions lead to different dynamical outcomes, for instance to periodic or chaotic behavior. Firstly, we analytically prove the boundedness of the trajectories in the system's attractor. The complexity of the coupling between the dynamical variables is quantified using observability indices. Our calculations reveal that the highest observable variable is the population of cancer cells, thus indicating that these cells could be monitored in future experiments in order to obtain time series for attractor's reconstruction. We identify different dynamical behaviors of the system varying two biologically meaningful parameters: r1, representing the uncontrolled proliferation rate of cancer cells, and k1, denoting the immune system's killing rate of cancer cells. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is computed to identify the chaotic regimes.  Considering very recent developments in the literature related to the homotopy analysis method (HAM), we construct the explicit series solution of the cancer model and focus our analysis on the dynamical variable with the highest observability index.

Untangling Sequences: Behavior vs. External Causes," View ORCID ProfileSubutai Ahmad, Jeff Hawkins",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"There are two fundamental reasons why sensory inputs to the brain change over time. Sensory inputs can change due to external factors or they can change due to our own behavior. Interpreting behavior-generated changes requires knowledge of how the body is moving, whereas interpreting externally-generated changes relies solely on the temporal sequence of input patterns. The sensory signals entering the neocortex change due to a mixture of both behavior and external factors. The neocortex must disentangle them but the mechanisms are unknown. In this paper, we show that a single neural mechanism can learn and recognize both types of sequences. In the model, cells are driven by feedforward sensory input and are modulated by contextual input. If the contextual input includes information derived from efference motor copies, the cells learn sensorimotor sequences.

Recent progress in multi-electrode spike sorting methods,"Baptiste Lefebvre, Pierre Yger, Olivier Marre",Now published in Journal of Physiology-Paris. 2016,"In recent years, arrays of extracellular electrodes have been developed and manufactured to record simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes packed with a high density. These recordings should allow neuroscientists to reconstruct the individual activity of the neurons spiking in the vicinity of these electrodes, with the help of signal processing algorithms. Algorithms need to solve a source separation problem, also known as spike sorting. However, these new devices challenge the classical way to do spike sorting. Here we review different methods that have been developed to sort spikes from these large-scale recordings. We describe the common properties of these algorithms, as well as their main differences.

Transcripts evolutionary conservation and structural dynamics give insights into the role of alternative splicing for the JNK family.,"Adel Ait-hamlat, Lelia Polit, Hugues Richard,  View ORCID ProfileElodie Laine",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Alternative splicing (AS), by producing several transcript isoforms from the same gene, has the potential to greatly expand the proteome in eukaryotes. Its deregulation has been associated to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Although the AS mechanisms are well described at the genomic level, little is known about the contribution of AS to protein evolution and the impact of AS at the level of the protein structure. Here, we address both issues by reconstructing the evolutionary history of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family, and by describing the tertiary structures and dynamical behavior of several JNK isoforms. JNKs bear a great interest for medicinal research as they are involved in crucial signaling pathways. We reconstruct the phylogenetic forest relating 60 JNK transcripts observed in 7 species. We use it to estimate the evolutionary conservation of transcripts and to identify ASEs likely to be functionally important. We show that ASEs of ancient origin and having significant functional outcome may induce very subtle changes on the protein's structural dynamics. We also propose that phylogenetic reconstruction, combined with structural modeling, can help identify new potential therapeutic targets. Finally, we show that transcripts likely non-functional (i.e. not conserved) display peculiar sequence and structural properties. Our approach is implemented in PhyloSofS (Phylogenies of Splicing Isoforms Structures), a fully automated computational tool that infers plausible evolutionary scenarios explaining a set of transcripts observed in several species and models the three-dimensional structures of the protein isoforms.

Recently, cutting-edge deep learning technologies have rapidly expanded into numerous fields, including medical image analysis. This paper outlines state-of-the-art deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimer′s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) from normal healthy control data for a given age group. Using these pipelines, which were executed on a GPU-based high-performance computing platform, the data were strictly and carefully preprocessed. Next, scale- and shift-invariant low- to high-level features were obtained from a high volume of training images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this study, fMRI data were used for the first time in deep learning applications for the purposes of medical image analysis and Alzheimer′s disease prediction. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate a significant improvement in classification output over other studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 99.9% and 98.84% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Additionally, for clinical purposes, subject-level classification was performed, resulting in an average accuracy rate of 94.32% and 97.88% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively.

PLP mutant centrioles exhibit four major defects: (1) They are too short and have subtle structural defects; (2) They separate prematurely, and so overduplicate; (3) They organise fewer MTs during interphase; (4) They fail to establish and/or maintain a proper connection to the plasma membrane, although, surprisingly, mutant centrioles can still form an axoneme and recruit transition zone (TZ) proteins. We show that PLP helps to form pericentriolar clouds of electron-dense material that emanate from the central cartwheel spokes and spread outward to surround the mother centriole.

Improving tauG-Control Of Action In PD,"Benjaman Schogler, Rachel Polokoff, Gert-Jan Pepping, Jon Perkins, David Lee",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"A theory of action control (General Tau Theory) is applied to analyzing normal and abnormal movements in PD; and to designing and testing the efficacy of a sonic aid for PD. A central aspect of the theory, which is supported by experimental evidence across a variety of actions and species, is that the trajectories of competent skilled actions follow a particular temporal pattern, which is described by the mathematical function, tauG. Since tauG-control of actions can be largely deficient in PD, we designed a device that generates whoop-like sounds, where the fundamental frequency of the sound follows the tauG pattern. Our hypothesis was that by listening to these sounds the nervous system of someone with PD might be helped subsequently to self-generate tauG patterns in their nervous system, which might facilitate movement control in different situations. Five adults with PD, and five age-matched controls, took part in the study. They each listened to the sounds under two conditions: (a) experimental - turning a handle for 5 minutes while the sounds were played (b) control - turning the handle without the sounds. Before and after each condition, the tauG-control of lateral body sway while standing was measured (without the sounds playing), using force-plates, on two tasks: (i) keeping the feet down, (ii) lifting the trailing foot. The number of participants out of five, who showed greater ratio improvement following practice with whoop sounds compared to without sounds, was, on each task, high for the PDs compared with the age-matched controls (4 vs 2 or 3). Thus, for the PDs, listening to the tauG whoop-like sounds while performing one action (handle turning) improved subsequent tauG-control on a different task (body-swaying).",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/28/143313,biorxiv,2017,6cc9e320-774a-40ee-92c9-c31d4fcbfe0f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/28/143313.full.pdf

However, the majority of individuals with ASD diagnoses do not carry a rare, penetrant genetic risk factor. In fact, recent estimates suggest that most of the genetic liability of ASD is due to as yet undiscovered common, less penetrant inherited variation (Gaugler et al., 2014) which is much more difficult to detect. The study of extended, high-risk families adds significant information in our search for these common inherited risk factors. Here, we present results of a new, powerful pedigree analysis method (Shared Genomic Segments--SGS) on three large families from the Utah Autism Research Program.

These SPD-5 droplets recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 (XMAP215 homologue) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homologue).

Low-intensity focused ultrasound alters the latency and spatial patterns of sensory-evoked cortical responses in vivo.,"Jonathan A. N. Fisher, Iryna Gumenchuk",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The use of transcranial, low intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging neuromodulation technology that shows promise for both therapeutic and research applications. Compared with other noninvasive neuromodulation approaches, key technical advantages include high lateral resolution of stimulation and deep penetration depth. However, empirically observed effects in vivo are diverse; for example, variations in sonication location and waveform can alternatively elicit putatively inhibitory or excitatory effects. At a fundamental level, it is unclear how FUS alters the function of neural circuits at the site of sonication. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an approach to optically interrogate the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the cortex directly at the acoustic focus, thereby offering a glimpse into the local effects of FUS on distributed populations of neurons in vivo. Our experiments probed electrical activity through the use of voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and, in transgenic GCaMP6f mice, monitored associated Ca2+ responses. Our results directly demonstrate that low-intensity FUS adjusts both the kinetics and spatial patterns of sensory receptive fields at the acoustic focus in vivo. Although our experimental configuration limits interpretation to population activity, the use of VSDs ensures that the detected alterations reflect activity in cortical neurons, unobscured by signals in subcortical or laterally distant cortical regions. More generally, this optical measurement paradigm can be implemented to observe FUS-induced alterations in cortical representation with higher lateral resolution spatial versatility than is practical through more conventional electrode-based measurements.

An exact transformation of convolutional kernels applied directly to DNA/RNA sequences,"Yang Ding, Jingyi Li, Meng Wang, Ge Gao",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Motivation: The powerful learning ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform functional classification of DNA/RNA sequences could provide valuable clues for the discovery of underlying biological mechanisms. Currently, however, the only way to interpret the direct application of a convolutional kernel to DNA/RNA sequences is the heuristic construction of a position weight matrix (PWM) from fragments scored highly by that kernel; whether the resulting PWM still performs the sequence classification well is unclear.  Results: We developed a novel kernel-to-PWM transformation whose result is theoretically provable. Specifically, we proved that the log-likelihood of the resulting PWM of any DNA/RNA sequence is exactly the sum of a constant and the convolution of the original kernel on the same sequence. Importantly, we further proved that the resulting PWM demonstrates the same performance, in theory, as the original kernel under popular CNN frameworks. Surprisingly, our PWMs almost always outperformed heuristic ones at sequence classification, whether the discriminative motif was sequence- or structure-conserved. These results compelled us to further develop a maximum likelihood estimation of the optimal PWM for each kernel and a back-transformation of predefined PWMs into kernels. These tools can benefit the biological interpretation of kernel signals.

Frequency-specific neuromodulation of local and distant connectivity in aging & episodic memory function," View ORCID ProfileSimon W. Davis, Bruce Luber, David L. K. Murphy, Sarah H. Lisanby,  View ORCID ProfileRoberto Cabeza",Now published in Human Brain Mapping. 2017,"A growing literature has focused on the brain's ability to augment processing in local regions by recruiting distant communities of neurons in response to neural decline or insult. In particular, both younger and older adult populations recruit bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a means of compensating for increasing neural effort to maintain successful cognitive function. However, it remains unclear how local changes in neural activity affect the recruitment of this adaptive mechanism. To address this problem, we combined graph theoretical measures from functional MRI (fMRI) with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to resolve a central hypothesis: how do aged brains flexibly adapt to local changes in cortical activity? Specifically, we applied neuromodulation to increase or decrease local activity in a cortical region supporting successful memory encoding (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC) using 5Hz or 1Hz rTMS, respectively. We then assessed a region's local within-module degree (WMD), or the distributed between-module degree (BMD) between distant cortical communities. We predicted that (1) local stimulation-related deficits may be counteracted by boosting BMD between bilateral PFC, and that this effect should be (2) positively correlated with structural connectivity. Both predictions were confirmed; 5Hz rTMS increased local success-related activity and local increases in PFC connectivity, while 1Hz rTMS decreases local activity and triggered a more distributed pattern of bilateral PFC connectivity to compensate for this local inhibitory effect.

H&E-stained Whole Slide Image Deep Learning Predicts SPOP Mutation State in Prostate Cancer," View ORCID ProfileAndrew J Schaumberg,  View ORCID ProfileMark A Rubin, Thomas J Fuchs",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"A quantitative model to genetically interpret the histology in whole microscopy slide images is desirable to guide downstream immunohistochemistry, genomics, and precision medicine.

We constructed a statistical model that predicts whether or not SPOP is mutated in prostate cancer, given only the digital whole slide after standard hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] staining.

Using a TCGA cohort of 177 prostate cancer patients where 20 had mutant SPOP, we trained multiple ensembles of residual networks, accurately distinguishing SPOP mutant from SPOP non-mutant patients (test AUROC=0.74, p=0.0007 Fisher's Exact Test).  We further validated our full metaensemble classifier on an independent test cohort from MSK-IMPACT of 152 patients where 19 had mutant SPOP.  Mutants and non-mutants were accurately distinguished despite TCGA slides being frozen sections and MSK-IMPACT slides being formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (AUROC=0.86, p=0.0038).
Moreover, we scanned an additional 36 MSK-IMPACT patient having mutant SPOP, trained on this expanded MSK-IMPACT cohort (test AUROC=0.75, p=0.0002), tested on the TCGA cohort (AUROC=0.64, p=0.0306), and again accurately distinguished mutants from non-mutants using the same pipeline.
Importantly, our method demonstrates tractable deep learning in this ""small data"" setting of 20-55 positive examples and quantifies each prediction's uncertainty with confidence intervals.

To our knowledge, this is the first statistical model to predict a genetic mutation in cancer directly from the patient's digitized H&E-stained whole microscopy slide.  Moreover, this is the first time quantitative features learned from patient genetics and histology have been used for content-based image retrieval, finding similar patients for a given patient where the histology appears to share the same genetic driver of disease i.e. SPOP mutation (p=0.0241 Kost's Method), and finding similar patients for a given patient that does not have have that driver mutation (p=0.0170 Kost's Method).","['ajs625@cornell.edu', 'rubinma@med.cornell.edu', 'fuchst@mskcc.org', '0.00024@0.5', '0.863@0.495', '0.819@0.495', '0.00017@0.5', '0.642@0.495', '0.664@0.495']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/064279.1,biorxiv,2017,f7431639-d6cc-48f2-8772-8fdb4fd6f2e7,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/064279.1.full.pdf

Simulated cell populations were linked with subject-specific white-matter connectivity estimates and driven by electroencephalography-derived electric source activity.  The models were fit to subject-specific resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and overfitting was excluded using 5-fold cross-validation. Further evaluation of the models show how balancing excitation with feedback inhibition generates an inverse relationship between α-rhythms and population firing on a faster time scale and resting-state network oscillations on a slower time scale.

Systematic Functional Annotation and Visualization of Biological Networks, View ORCID ProfileAnastasia Baryshnikova,Now published in Cell Systems. 2016,"Large-scale biological networks map functional connections between most genes in the genome and can potentially uncover high level organizing principles governing cellular functions. These networks, however, are famously complex and often regarded as disordered masses of tangled interactions (""hairballs"") that are nearly impenetrable to biologists. As a result, our current understanding of network functional organization is very limited. To address this problem, I developed a systematic quantitative approach for annotating biological networks and examining their functional structure. This method, named Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), detects network regions that are statistically overrepresented for a functional group or a quantitative phenotype of interest, and provides an intuitive visual representation of their relative positioning within the network. By successfully annotating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic interaction network with Gene Ontology terms, SAFE proved to be sensitive to functional signals and robust to noise. In addition, SAFE annotated the network with chemical genomic data and uncovered a new potential mechanism of resistance to the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. Finally, SAFE showed that protein-protein interactions, despite their apparent complexity, also have a high level functional structure.

Deep learning is effective for the classification of OCT images of normal versus Age-related Macular Degeneration," View ORCID ProfileCecilia S Lee, Doug M Baughman,  View ORCID ProfileAaron Y Lee",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Objective:  The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

Design: EMR and OCT database study

Subjects: Normal and AMD patients who had a macular OCT.

Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. 

Main outcome measure: Area under the ROC.

Results: Of a recent extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal macular OCT images and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively.

Deep learning has become the approach of choice for modeling regulatory sequences because of its strength to learn complex sequence features. However, modeling relative distances to genomic landmarks in deep neural networks has not been addressed. Here we developed spline transformation, a neural network module based on splines to flexibly and robustly model distances. Modeling distances to various genomic landmarks with spline transformations significantly increased state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of in vivo RNA-binding protein binding sites for 114 out of 123 proteins. We also developed a deep neural network for human splice branchpoint based on spline transformations that outperformed the current best, already distance-based, machine learning model. Compared to piecewise linear transformation, as obtained by composition of rectified linear units, spline transformation yields higher prediction accuracy as well as faster and more robust training. As spline transformation can be applied to further quantities beyond distances, such as methylation or conservation, we foresee it as a versatile component in the genomics deep learning toolbox.

This type of barcoding is not always effective when applied to species separated by short divergence times or that contain introgressed genes from closely related species. Herein we introduce a more effective multi-locus barcoding framework that is based on gene capture and ""next-generation"" sequencing and provide both empirical and simulation tests of its efficacy. We examine genetic distinctness in two pairs of fishes that are sister-species: Siniperca chuatsi vs. S. kneri and Sicydium altum vs. S. adelum, where the COI barcoding approach failed species identification in both cases. Results revealed that distinctness between S. chuatsi and S. kneri increased as more independent loci were added. By contrast S. altum and S. adelum could not be distinguished even with all loci. Analyses of population structure and gene flow suggested that the two species of Siniperca diverged from each other a long time ago but have unidirectional gene flow, whereas the two species of Sicydium are not separated from each other and have high bidirectional gene flow. Simulations demonstrate that under limited gene flow (< 0.00001 per gene per generation) and enough separation time (> 100000 generation), we can correctly identify species using more than 90 loci.

Here, we address this concern in the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea) by taking advantage of an extensive dataset of floral traits, genetic estimates of selfing and inbreeding, and relevant environmental factors compiled for 22 populations of this species distributed along a disparate set of environments along Southeast and Midwest USA. Combining a powerful array of parametric and model-free statistical approaches, we robustly identify a set of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors underlying population-level variation in selfing, inbreeding, and flower morphology. Remarkably, individual mating system components are found to be associated with different environmental factors and only loosely associated with each other, and thus potentially under multiple different selective pressures. These results not only corroborate theoretical expectations of the significant role the environment plays in the local determination of mating systems, but also provide compelling evidence of complex underlying interactions between multiple evolutionary processes.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/17/138982,biorxiv,2017,a0d0a3ad-3856-4ab9-b898-45c314db777f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/17/138982.full.pdf

Marshall",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Cells in culture display diverse motility behaviors. In multiple contexts, motility behaviors reflect broader cell function, providing motivation to discriminate between different motility behaviors. Current methods to do so rely upon manual feature engineering. However, the types of features necessary to distinguish between motility behaviors can vary greatly depending on the biological context, and it is not always clear which features may be most predictive in each setting for distinguishing particular cell types or disease states. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of machine learning models ideally suited to the analysis of spatial data, allowing for relevant spatial features to be learned as parameters of a model. Given that motility data is inherently spatial, CNNs are a promising approach to learn relevant features for motility analysis from data, rather than requiring a domain expert to engineer features by hand. Here, we apply CNNs to classify different motility behaviors by representing motility as a 3D space with markers denoting a cell location at each time point. 3D CNNs provide accurate classification of several simulated motility behaviors, the motility behaviors of multiple cell types, and characteristic motility behaviors of commitment states in myogenic cells. Autoencoders were trained effectively to learn representations of these 3D motility spaces in an unsupervised manner. We show that this approach can achieve reliable detection of differentiation state for muscle stem cells and better-than-chance detection of neoplastic transformation in a cancer cell model. The variety of cell type differences we can detect suggests that the algorithm is generally applicable to novel cell types. While we have applied these methods to the analysis of cell motility, our scheme for representing motion spatially for analysis by CNNs is generalizable to other motion classification problems.","['Wallace.Marshall@ucsf.edu', 'drew.Brack@ucsf.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/12/159202,biorxiv,2017,0e76458a-a746-4e35-baa3-cb40aadd669a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/12/159202.full.pdf

However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains the observed dynamics of learning.

However, there are multiple populations of interneurons and their respective roles in psychiatric disease remain poorly explored.  Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its interneuron-specific tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB4 are risk genes for schizophrenia, and the Nrg1/ErbB4 pathway is important for normal cortical development.  Using a conditional ErbB4 deletion model, we directly tested the role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons in schizophrenia-related deficits in vivo.  ErbB4 removal from VIP interneurons during development leads to changes in their activity, along with severe dysregulation of the temporal organization and state-dependence of cortical activity.  As a result of these neural circuit alterations, animals in which VIP interneurons lack ErbB4 exhibit behavioral abnormalities, reduced cortical responses to sensory stimuli, and impaired sensory learning.  Our data support a key role for VIP interneurons in normal cortical circuit development and suggest that their disruption contributes to pathophysiology in the ErbB4 model of schizophrenia.

The current study quantifies the spatial prominence of such lateral activity spreads by demonstrating that functional connectivity between laterally spaced cortical locations is actually stronger than between vertically spaced cortical locations. Further, the total amount of evoked activity within and beyond single column boundaries was quantified based on intrinsic signal optical imaging, single units and local field potentials (LFPs) recordings, revealing that the vast majority of whisker evoked activity in PMBSF occurs beyond columnar boundaries. Finally, a simple two layer artificial neural network model of PMBSF demonstrates the capacity of extra-columnar evoked activity spread to provide a foundation for accurate whisker stimulus classification that is robust to random scaling of inputs and local noise.

When selection favors the production of a mix of offspring types, this mix differs according to the parental phenotype, implying that parental effects are favored over selection for bet-hedging in which the mixture of offspring phenotypes produced does not depend on the parental phenotype. Positive parental effects (generating a positive correlation between parental and offspring phenotype) are favored in relatively stable habitats and when different types of local environment are roughly equally abundant, and can give rise to long-term parental inheritance of phenotypes. By contrast, unstable habitats can favor negative parental effects (generating a negative correlation between parental and offspring phenotype), and under these circumstances even slight asymmetries in the abundance of local environmental states select for marked asymmetries in transmission fidelity.",['Legion@UCL'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/23/027441,biorxiv,2015,e5af770f-d7ee-416d-a994-fbcb8ace8991,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/23/027441.full.pdf

Multiple sequence alignments of drug-experienced HIV-1 protease sequences contain networks of many pair correlations which can be used to build a (Potts) Hamiltonian model of these mutation patterns.  Using this Hamiltonian model we translate HIV protease sequence covariation data into quantitative predictions for the probability of observing specific mutation patterns which are in agreement with the observed sequence statistics.  We find that the statistical energies of the Potts model are correlated with the fitness of individual proteins containing therapy-associated mutations as estimated by in vitro measurements of protein stability and viral infectivity.  We show that the penalty for acquiring primary resistance mutations depends on the epistatic interactions with the sequence background.  Primary mutations which lead to drug resistance can become highly advantageous (or entrenched) by the complex mutation patterns which arise in response to drug therapy despite being destabilizing in the wildtype background.

This study examined whether changes in cortical thickness (CT) scaled with BN symptom severity in a sample of 33 adult women (n = 10 BN; n = 5 EDNOS-BN). Our second objective was to assess global structural connectivity (SC) of CT and to determine if individual differences in global SC relate to BN symptom severity. We used the validated Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q; Fairburn & Beglin, 1994) as a continuous measure of BN symptom severity. Increased EDE-Q score was negatively related to global CT and local CT in the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and temporoparietal regions. Moreover, analysis of global SC indicated that BN-related cortical thinning preferentially occurred in regions with high global connectivity. Finally, we showed that individuals' contribution to global SC at the group level were significantly related to EDE-Q score, where increased EDE-Q score correlated with reduced connectivity of the left OFC and middle temporal cortex and increased connectivity of the right superior parietal lobule.

In the case of sepsis, a debilitating, dysregulated host response to infection, extracting subtle, uncataloged clinical phenotypes from the EMR with statistical machine learning methods has the potential to impact patient diagnosis and treatment early in the course of their hospitalization. However, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to extract these insights from EMR data. First, EMR datasets consist of both static and dynamic observations of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many of which may be missing, precluding the application of standard multivariate analysis techniques. Second, clinical populations observed via EMRs and relevant to the study and management of conditions like sepsis are often heterogeneous; properly accounting for this heterogeneity is critical. Here, we describe an unsupervised, probabilistic framework called a composite mixture model that can simultaneously accommodate the wide variety of observations frequently observed in EMR datasets, characterize heterogeneous clinical populations, and handle missing observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large-scale sepsis cohort, developing novel techniques built on our model-based clusters to track patient mortality risk over time and identify physiological trends and distinct subgroups of the dataset associated with elevated risk of mortality during hospitalization.","['mayhew5@llnl.gov', 'petersen33@llnl.gov', 'apsales@llnl.gov', 'john.d.greene@kp.org', 'vincent.x.liu@kp.org', 'twasson@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/18/160465,biorxiv,2017,1936b603-cd03-451d-876c-72f2e2642527,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/18/160465.full.pdf

Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit.

To circumvent this problem, we introduce here a novel likelihood-free inference framework by applying deep learning, a powerful modern technique in machine learning.  In contrast to Approximate Bayesian Computation, another likelihood-free approach widely used in population genetics and other fields, deep learning does not require a distance function on summary statistics or a rejection step, and it is robust to the addition of uninformative statistics.  To demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed to estimate population genetic parameters and learn informative features of data, we focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography (in the form of a population size change history). Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. Studying demography and selection jointly is motivated by Drosophila, where pervasive selection confounds demographic analysis.  We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography, and regions of their genome under selection.   We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation (soft sweep) or balancing selection.  Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome.

Our methods are both statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to not only rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models, but also efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. We apply our framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning STAs and STCs to similar accuracy using just 12% of recorded data, reducing experiment time by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we learn three layer nonlinear models of retinal circuitry, consisting of thousands of parameters, using only 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. The internal structure of these models reveals that hidden nonlinear subunits match the properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits had consistently high thresholds, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model's parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space-a central tenet of efficient coding theory-originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses.

Florencia Camus, Jonci N Wolff, Carla M Sgro, Damian K Dowling",Now published in Molecular Biology and Evolution. 2017,"Cellular metabolism is regulated by enzyme complexes within the mitochondrion, the function of which are sensitive to the prevailing temperature. Such thermal sensitivity, coupled with the observation that population frequencies of mitochondrial haplotypes tend to associate with latitude, altitude or climatic regions across species distributions, led to the hypothesis that thermal selection has played a role in shaping standing variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence.This hypothesis, however, remains controversial, and requires evidence that the distribution of haplotypes observed in nature corresponds with the capacity of these haplotypes to confer differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, haplotypes predominating in tropical climates are predicted to encode increased tolerance to heat stress, but decreased tolerance to cold stress. We present direct evidence for these predictions, using mtDNA haplotypes sampled from the Australian distribution of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the ability of flies to tolerate extreme thermal challenges is affected by sequence variation across mtDNA haplotypes, and that the thermal performance associated with each haplotype corresponds with its latitudinal prevalence. The haplotype that predominates at low (subtropical) latitudes confers greater resilience to heat stress, but lower resilience to cold stress, than haplotypes predominating at higher (temperate) latitudes. We explore molecular mechanisms that might underlie these responses, presenting evidence that the effects are in part regulated by SNPs that do not change the protein sequence.

The benefits of finer taxonomic resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for SV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits deriving from the status of SVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how those features grant SVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs -- including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed datasets, and forward prediction -- and of de novo OTUs -- including accurate diversity measurement and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases.

We found an enhanced sensory response for unexpected stimuli, which was elicited only when there was a violation of expectation at the specific location where participants formed a stimulus expectation.

Here, we record neuronal activity from a sensorimotor decision area, the superior colliculus (SC), during two different tasks to investigate whether population-level activity in this area signals different types of perceptual confidence. In one task, decision accuracy and confidence co-vary, allowing us to determine if neural activity in the SC reflects 'optimal confidence,' as previously demonstrated in cortical areas. In our second task, we implement a novel motion discrimination task with stimuli that are matched for decision accuracy (and thus 'optimal confidence') but produce different behavioral reports about confidence (i.e., 'subjective confidence'). In our first task, we predicted choices from neuronal population activity using a multivariate decoder and found that decoding performance increased as decision accuracy increased, indicating a role for the SC in optimal confidence. In our second task, across two conditions in which decision accuracy was matched, performance of the decoder was similar between high and low confidence conditions, indicating the SC is unlikely to be involved in subjective confidence. These results show that the SC signals optimal decision confidence similar to area LIP of cortex and also motivate future investigations to determine where in the brain signals related to subjective confidence reside.",['odegaard.brian@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/30/157123,biorxiv,2017,5b35e8cc-43d3-4548-b26e-53a29573af18,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/30/157123.full.pdf

Social affective behaviors include avoiding sick individuals, reproductive acts, and cooperative behaviors. In a social affective behavioral test in which experimental adult rats were given the choice to interact with either naïve or distressed conspecifics, the experimental rats demonstrated both approach and avoidant social affective behaviors depending upon the age of the conspecific; experimental adult rats approached the distressed juvenile but avoided the stressed adult. Optogenetic inhibition of the insular cortex, a region implicated in social cognition, disrupted these social affective behaviors. Receptors for the social nonapeptide oxytocin (OT) are found in high density within the insular cortex and oxytocin increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic efficacy in acute insular cortex slices. Insular blockade of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) eliminated the social affective behaviors, while direct administration of OT to insular cortex recapitulated the behaviors typically observed in response to distressed conspecifics.

We found that initiation of these actions is selectively encoded by two non-overlapping populations of OFC neurons, and that the relative size and differential pre-choice activity of the cocaine action-coding population determine an individual preference, a larger size and a higher pre-choice activity being associated with cocaine preference. A larger size is a structural feature that may confer to a population of OFC neurons a competitive advantage during choice in favor of the encoded action.

Prioritizing 2nd and 3rd order interactions via support vector ranking using sensitivity indices on static Wnt measurements,shriprakash sinha,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, DACT3 is known to be a epigenetic regulator of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer and subject to histone modifications. But many of the nth ≥ 2 order interactions of DACT3 that might be influential have not been explored/tested. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (≥ 2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. The computational ranking sheds light on unexplored combinations that can further be investigated using hypothesis testing based on wet lab experiments. Here, the basic framework and results obtained on 2nd and 3rd order interactions for members of family of DACT, SFRP, DKK (to name a few) in both normal and tumor cases is presented using a static data set.","['sinha.shriprakash@yandex.com', '-6@77']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/059469,biorxiv,2017,8a314199-97e8-4de4-a843-0a41a8eae52f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/059469.full.pdf

Supervised machine learning reveals introgressed loci in the genomes of Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia,"Daniel Schrider, Julien Ayroles, Daniel R. Matute, Andrew D.

Even though it is clear that hybridization is widespread across all surveyed taxonomic groups, the magnitude and consequences of introgression are still largely unknown. Thus it is crucial to develop the statistical machinery required to uncover which genomic regions have recently acquired haplotypes via introgression from a sister population. We developed a novel machine learning framework, called FILET (Finding Introgressed Loci via Extra-Trees) capable of revealing genomic introgression with far greater power than competing methods. FILET works by combining information from a number of population genetic summary statistics, including several new statistics that we introduce, that capture patterns of variation across two populations. We show that FILET is able to identify loci that have experienced gene flow between related species with high accuracy, and in most situations can correctly infer which population was the donor and which was the recipient. Here we describe a data set of outbred diploid Drosophila sechellia genomes, and combine them with data from D. simulans to examine recent introgression between these species using FILET. Although we find that these populations may have split more recently than previously appreciated, FILET confirms that there has indeed been appreciable recent introgression (some of which might have been adaptive) between these species, and reveals that this gene flow is primarily in the direction of D. simulans to D. sechellia.",['dan.schrider@rutgers.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/170670,biorxiv,2017,01530806-62d1-4a45-b18f-e913bc734cba,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/170670.full.pdf

Another model species that is widely used in electrophysiological or developmental studies is the ferret; however, no systematic compilation of brain connectivity is currently available for this species. Thus, we have started developing a database of anatomical connections and architectonic features of the ferret brain (the Ferretome, www.ferretome.org). The main goals of this database project are: (1) to assemble structural information on the ferret brain that is currently widely distributed in the literature or in different in-house laboratory databases into a single resource which is open to the scientific community; (2) to try and build an extendable community resource that is beneficial to researchers in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, as well as to neuroanatomists, by adding value to their data through algorithms for efficient data representation, analysis and visualization; (3) to create techniques for the representation of quantitative and raw data; and (4) to expand existing database ontologies in order to accommodate further neuroarchitectural information for identifying essential relations between brain structure and connections.
The Ferretome database has adapted essential features of the CoCoMac methodology and legacy. In particular, its data model is derived from CoCoMac. It also uses a semantic parcellation of ferret brain regions as well as a logical brain maps transformation algorithm (objective relational transformation, ORT). The database is being developed in MySQL and has been populated with literature reports on tract tracing observations in the ferret brain using a custom-designed web interface that allows efficient and validated simultaneous input and proofreading by multiple curators. The database is also equipped with a web interface for generating output data that was designed with non-computer science specialist users in mind. This interface can be extended to produce connectivity matrices in several formats including a graphical representation superimposed on established ferret brain maps. An important feature of the Ferretome database is the possibility to trace back entries in connectivity matrices to the original studies archived in the system.
Currently, the Ferretome contains 50 reports on connections comprising 20 injection reports with more than 150 labeled source and target areas, the majority reflecting connectivity of subcortical nuclei. We hope that the Ferretome database will become a useful resource for neuroinformatics and neural modeling, and will support studies of the ferret brain as well as facilitate advances in comparative studies of mesoscopic brain connectivity.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/22/014134,biorxiv,2015,fbd23811-b53a-41cc-bc7c-0e93370bc2d8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/22/014134.full.pdf

Compressive Temporal Summation in Human Visual Cortex,"Jingyang Zhou, Noah C Benson,  View ORCID ProfileKendrick Kay,  View ORCID ProfileJonathan Winawer",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Combining sensory inputs over space and time is fundamental to vision. Population receptive field models have been highly successful in characterizing spatial encoding throughout the human visual pathways. A parallel question-how visual areas in the human brain process information distributed over time-has received less attention. One challenge is that the most widely used neuroimaging method-fMRI-has coarse temporal resolution compared to the time scale of neural dynamics. Here, via carefully controlled temporally modulated stimuli, we show that information about temporal processing can be readily derived from fMRI signal amplitudes. We find that all visual areas exhibit subadditive summation, whereby responses to longer stimuli are less than the linear prediction from briefer stimuli. We also find fMRI evidence that the neural response to two stimuli is reduced for brief interstimulus intervals (indicating adaptation). These effects are more pronounced in anterior visual areas than V1-V3. Finally, we develop a general model that shows how all of these effects can be captured with two simple operations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. This model operates for arbitrary temporal stimulation patterns and provides a simple and interpretable set of computations that can be used to characterize neural response properties across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, compressive temporal summation directly parallels earlier findings of compressive spatial summation in human visual cortex describing responses to stimuli distributed across space. This indicates that for space and time, cortex uses a similar processing strategy to achieve higher-level and increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.",['jingyang.zhou@nyu.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/14/157628,biorxiv,2017,42793f63-088f-4bed-a011-7c345c920f93,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/14/157628.full.pdf

Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data.

Calibrating the Human Mutation Rate via Ancestral Recombination Density in Diploid Genomes,"Mark Lipson, Po-Ru Loh, Sriram Sankararaman, Nick Patterson, Bonnie Berger, David Reich",Now published in PLOS Genetics. 2015,"The human mutation rate is an essential parameter for studying the evolution of our species, interpreting present-day genetic variation, and understanding the incidence of genetic disease.

Here, we propose a new method that uses the fine-scale human recombination map to calibrate the rate of accumulation of mutations. By comparing local heterozygosity levels in diploid genomes to the genetic distance scale over which these levels change, we are able to estimate a long-term mutation rate averaged over hundreds or thousands of generations. We infer a rate of 1.61 +/- 0.13 x 10^(-8) mutations per base per generation, which falls in between phylogenetic and pedigree-based estimates, and we suggest possible mechanisms to reconcile our estimate with previous studies.

The development of scientific consensus: analyzing conflict and concordance among Avian phylogenies," View ORCID ProfileJoseph Brown, Ning Wang, Stephen Smith",Now published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 2017,"Recent developments in phylogenetic methods and data acquisition have allowed for the construction of large and comprehensive phylogenetic relationships. Published phylogenies represent an enormous resource that not only facilitate the resolution of questions related to comparative biology, but also provide a resource on which to gauge the development of consensus across the tree of life. From the Open Tree of Life, we gathered 290 avian phylogenies representing all major groups that have been published over the last few decades and analyzed how concordance and conflict develop among these trees through time. Nine large scale backbone trees (including a new synthesis tree from this study) were used for the consensus assessment. We found that conflicts were over-represented along the backbone (higher-level relationships) of the avian phylogeny and within Passeriformes. Importantly, although we have made major strides in our knowledge of major clades, recent published comprehensive trees, as well as trees of individual clades, continue to contribute significantly to the resolution of clades in the avian phylogeny. These findings are somewhat unexpected, given that birds constitute a relatively well-studied and small clade of the tree of life (i.e., Aves).

MotifMark: Finding Regulatory Motifs in DNA Sequences,Hamid Reza Hassanzadeh,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The interaction between proteins and DNA is a key driving force in a significant number of biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, repair, recombination, splicing, and DNA modification. The identification of DNA-binding sites and the specificity of target proteins in binding to these regions are two important steps in understanding the mechanisms of these biological activities. A number of high-throughput technologies have recently emerged that try to quantify the affinity between proteins and DNA motifs. Despite their success, these technologies have their own limitations and fall short in precise characterization of motifs, and as a result, require further downstream analysis to extract useful and interpretable information from a haystack of noisy and inaccurate data. Here we propose MotifMark, a new algorithm based on graph theory and machine learning, that can find binding sites on candidate probes and rank their specificity in regard to the underlying transcription factor. We developed a pipeline to analyze experimental data derived from compact universal protein binding microarrays and benchmarked it against two of the most accurate motif search methods. Our results indicate that MotifMark can be a viable alternative technique for prediction of motif from protein binding microarrays and possibly other related high-throughput techniques.","['hassanzadeh@gatech.edu', 'isbell@cc.gatech.edu', 'pushkar@cc.gatech.edu', 'maywang@bme.gatech.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/05/134296,biorxiv,2017,e0e208cd-5a30-46b1-a703-023e1ff56888,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/05/134296.full.pdf

Our first model is low-dimensional and scales linearly in the number of brain parcels. Our second model scales quadratically. We apply both models to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) comparing connectivity between short and conventional sleepers. We find stronger functional connectivity in short than conventional sleepers in brain areas consistent with previous findings. This might be due to subjects falling asleep in the scanner. Consequently, we recommend the inclusion of average sleep duration as a covariate to remove unwanted variation in rfMRI studies.

We find that contextual fear conditioning is modulated by shock intensity, prevented by inhibition of (N-methyl-D-aspartate) NMDA receptors, lasts at least 14 days, and exhibits extinction. Furthermore, fish of various background strains (AB, Tu, and TL) are able to acquire fear conditioning, but differ in fear extinction rates.

Furthermore, β expression in primary motor cortex (M1) distinguishes two BG dynamical states. In one, β oscillations increase in both striatum and M1, with partial directed coherence occurring primarily from striatum to M1 and distinguishing between β subbands. In another, M1 is characterized by persistent β-HFO phase-amplitude coupling, and shows no β increase. This suggests: (1) striatal cholinergic tone exerts state-dependent and frequency-selective control over CBT β power and coordination; (2) ongoing rhythmic dynamics can determine whether elevated striatal β oscillations are expressed in M1; (3) altered striatal cholinergic tone differentially modulates distinct β subbands.","['benpolletta@gmail.com', 'xuehan@bu.edu', 'mmccart@bu.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/148551,biorxiv,2017,601946e0-1a8e-4de2-92f3-4b91df991486,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/148551.full.pdf
FiberNET: An ensemble deep learning framework for clustering white matter fibers,"Vikash Gupta, Sophia I Thomopoulos, Faisal M Rashid, Paul M Thompson",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"White matter tracts are commonly analyzed in studies of micro-structural integrity and anatomical connectivity in the brain. Over the last decade, it has been an open problem as to how best to cluster  white matter fibers, extracted from whole-brain tractography, into anatomically meaningful groups. Some existing techniques use region of interest (ROI) based clustering, atlas-based labeling, or unsupervised spectral clustering. ROI-based clustering is popular for analyzing anatomical connectivity among a set of ROIs, but it does not always partition the brain into recognizable fiber bundles. Here we propose an approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn shape features of the fiber bundles, which are then exploited to cluster white matter fibers. To achieve such clustering, we first need to re-parameterize the fibers in an intrinsic space. The clustering is performed in induced parameterized coordinates. To our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches for fiber clustering using  deep learning techniques.

O'Connor,  View ORCID ProfileGail L. Rosen",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Analysis of microbiome data involves identifying co-occurring groups of taxa associated with sample features of interest (e.g., disease state). But elucidating key associations is often difficult since microbiome data are compositional, high dimensional, and sparse. Also, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to, for example, host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations. In addition, analyses that utilize both taxonomic and predicted functional abundances typically independently characterize the taxonomic and functional profiles before linking them to sample information. This prevents investigators from identifying the specific functional components associate with which subsets of co-occurring taxa. We provide an approach to explore co-occurring taxa using ""topics"" generated via a topic model and then link these topics to specific sample classes (e.g., diseased versus healthy). Rather than inferring predicted functional content independently from taxonomic abundances, we instead focus on inference of functional content within topics, which we parse by estimating pathway-topic interactions through a multilevel, fully Bayesian regression model. We apply our methods to two large publically available 16S amplicon sequencing datasets: an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dataset from Gevers et al. and data from the American Gut (AG) project. When applied to the Gevers et al. IBD study, we demonstrate that a topic highly associated with Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosis is (1) dominated by a cluster of bacteria known to be linked with CD and (2) uniquely enriched for a subset of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis genes. In the AG data, our approach found that individuals with plant-based diets were enriched with Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Blautia, and Ruminococcaceae, as well as fluorobenzoate degradation pathways, whereas pathways involved in LPS biosynthesis were depleted. We introduce an approach for uncovering latent thematic structure in the context of sample features for 16S rRNA surveys.

Recent experiments, ranging from high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing to quantification of the response to specific antigens, can help us characterize the effective dynamics of the immune response.

We discuss how different types of competition, noise and selection shape the observed clone-size distributions, and contrast them with predictions of a neutral theory of clonal evolution.

We show that that the score function may be manipulated into a form that facilitates intelligible interpretations of the results.

Such extreme genetic heterogeneity severely limits recurrence-based statistical power even in studies with a large sample size.  In addition, the cellular contexts in which these genomic lesions confer disease risks remain poorly understood.  Here we investigate the use of cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients or unaffected siblings.  Using 24 distinct cell types isolated from the mouse central nervous system, we identified an expression signature shared by genes with likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations detected by exome-sequencing in autism cases.  The signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons.  Based on this signature, we assigned a D score to all human genes to prioritize candidate autism-susceptibility genes.  When applied to genes with only a single LGD mutation in cases, the D score achieved a precision of 40% as compared to the 15% baseline with a minimal loss in sensitivity.  Further improvement was made by combining D score and mutation intolerance metrics from ExAC which were derived from orthogonal data sources.

"Multiple Confounders Correction with Regularized Linear Mixed Effect Models, with Application in Biological Processes","Haohan Wang, Jingkang Yang",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"In this paper, we inspect the performance of regularized linear mixed effect models, as an extension of linear mixed effect model, when multiple confounding factors coexist. We first review its parameter estimation algorithms before we introduce three different methods for multiple confounding factors correction, namely concatenation, sequence, and interpolation. Then we investigate the performance on variable selection task and predictive task on three different data sets, synthetic data set, semi-empirical synthetic data set based on genome sequences and brain wave data set connecting to confused mental states. Our results suggest that sequence multiple confounding factors corrections behave the best when different confounders contribute equally to response variables. On the other hand, when various confounders affect the response variable unevenly, results mainly rely on the degree of how the major confounder is corrected.","['haohanw@cs.cmu.edu', 'jk.yang1995@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/22/089052,biorxiv,2016,33dde62b-87ed-4e9e-88a4-9d48d348c75d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/22/089052.full.pdf

Utilizing a well-known visual motion paradigm that evokes behavioral suppression and facilitation, and combining 5 different methodologies (behavioral psychophysics, computational modeling, functional MRI, pharmacology, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), we provide evidence that challenges commonly held assumptions about the neural processes underlying suppression and facilitation. We show that: 1) both suppression and facilitation can emerge from a single, computational principle – divisive normalization; there is no need to invoke separate neural mechanisms, 2) neural suppression and facilitation in the motion-selective area MT mirror perception, but strong suppression also occurs in earlier visual areas, and 3) suppression is not driven by GABA-mediated inhibition.

Edge Detection of Cryptic Lamellipodia Assisted by Deep Learning,"Chuangqi Wang, Shawn Kang, Eunice Kim, Xitong Zhang, Hee June Choi, Aaron Choi, Kwonmoo Lee",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Cell protrusion plays important roles in cell migration by pushing plasma membrane forward. Cryptic lamellipodia induce the protrusion of submarginal cells in collective cell migration where cells are attached and move together. Although computational image analysis of cell protrusion has been done extensively, the study on protrusion activities of cryptic lamellipodia is limited due to difficulties in image segmentation. This study seeks to aid in the computational analysis of submarginal cell protrusion in collective cell migration by using deep learning to detect the cryptic lamellipodial edges from fluorescence time-lapse movies. Due to the noisy features within overlapping cells, the conventional image analysis algorithms such as Canny edge detector and intensity thresholding are limited. In this paper we combined Canny edge detector, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and local intensity thresholding. We were able to detect cryptic lamellipodial edges of submarginal cells with high accuracy from the fluorescence time-lapse movies of PtK1 cells using both simple convolutional neural networks and VGG-16 based neural networks. We used relatively small effort to prepare the training set to train the DNNs to detect the cryptical lamellipodial edges in fluorescence time-lapse movies. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be combined with the conventional image analysis algorithms to facilitate the computational analysis of highly complex time-lapse movies of collective cell migration.","['klee@wpi.edu', 'klee@wpi.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/13/181263,biorxiv,2017,0cde06a7-fbf0-4283-8424-702d3c11b1f7,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/13/181263.full.pdf

Inferring heterozygosity from ancient and low coverage genomes,"Athanasios Kousathanas, Christoph Leuenberger, Vivian Link, Christian Sell, Joachim Burger, Daniel Wegmann",Now published in Genetics. 2016,"While genetic diversity can be quantified accurately from high coverage sequencing, it is often desirable to obtain such estimates from low coverage data, either to save costs or because of low DNA quality as observed for ancient samples. Here we introduce a method to accurately infer heterozygosity probabilistically from very low coverage sequences of a single individual. The method relaxes the infinite sites assumption of previous methods, does not require a reference sequence and takes into account both variable sequencing errors and potential post-mortem damage. It is thus also applicable to non-model organisms and ancient genomes. Since error rates as reported by sequencing machines are generally distorted and require recalibration, we also introduce a method to infer accurately recalibration parameter in the presence of post-mortem damage. This method does also not require knowledge about the underlying genome sequence, but instead works from haploid data (e.g. from the X-chromosome from mammalian males) and integrates over the unknown genotypes. Using extensive simulations we show that a few Mb of haploid data is sufficient for accurate recalibration even at average coverages as low as 1-3x. At similar coverages, out method also produces very accurate estimates of heterozygosity down to $10^{-4}$ within windows of about 1Mb. We further illustrate the usefulness of our approach by inferring genome-wide patterns of diversity for several ancient human samples and found that 3,000-5,000 samples showed diversity patterns comparable to modern humans. In contrast, two European hunter-gatherer samples exhibited not only considerably lower levels of diversity than modern samples, but also highly distinct distributions of diversity along their genomes. Interestingly, these distributions were also very differently between the two samples, supporting earlier conclusions of a highly diverse and structured population in Europe prior to the arrival of farming.",['daniel.wegmann@unifr.ch'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/01/046748,biorxiv,2016,f7543889-72fb-4235-aa02-a6a65562aaaf,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/01/046748.full.pdf
Burst Ensemble Multiplexing: A Neural Code Connecting Dendritic Spikes with Microcircuits,"Richard Naud, Henning Sprekeler",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Thick-tufted pyramidal neurons of the neocortex receive distinct types of inputs impinging on different parts of their dendritic arborization. A popular view holds that inputs arriving on the distal dendrites modulate the firing rate arising from inputs onto the proximal dendrites by a multiplicative factor. Here, we propose an alternative view whereby a single neural ensemble combines the two input streams while preserving information specific to both through modulation of the burst probability. Using computational simulations constrained by experimental data, we show that this novel type of neural multiplexing can in principle represent fast input fluctuations in both input streams. We find that the representation of the dendritic input is in practice restricted by the size of the ensemble and the slow onset dynamics of dendritic spikes. Secondly, we find that a microcircuitry combining short-term facilitation, short-term depression and inhibition can decode somatic and dendritic information streams independently and serve to optimize encoding quality. Our results suggest a novel functional role of the stereotypical interconnection pattern of inhibitory cell types in the neocortex.

There is currently no method to dynamically control flies' access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner.

Research activity is primarily communicated via textual artifacts, ranging from grant applications to journal publications.

In this article, we pose the question of whether biomedical text mining techniques can assist the stakeholders in the biomedical research enterprise in doing their part towards enhancing research integrity and rigor.

Demarcating the anatomical structure of the claustrum: piecing together a new functional puddle,"Christopher M Dillingham, Bethany E Frost, Maciej M Jankowski, Marie AC Lambert, Shane M O'Mara",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: A major obstacle in the understanding of the functional anatomy of the claustrum has been, and continues to be, the contradiction surrounding its anatomical boundary and, in particular, its rostral (i.e. anterior to striatum), extent. In a recent review we highlighted gene expression-based evidence from the mouse brain which lends weight to the idea that the anatomical boundary of the claustrum does in fact extend rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. In light of this evidence, in the present study, we have examined the expression of two genes that have previously been identified as having differential expression in the mouse claustrum, with the aim of: 1, establishing the true neuroanatomical boundaries of the rat claustrum; and 2, determining the efficacy of claustral marker expression in the histological verification of claustral electrode placement following electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving rats. 
Methods: The expression profiles of two genes, crystallin mu (Crym) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma 2 (Gng2) were assessed immunohistochemically in five male rats (one Wistar Kyoto (WK) and four Lister hooded (LH)). Prior to histological analysis, two of the rats had undergone surgical implantation of tetrodes targeting the putative rostral claustrum. 
Results: In results that are consistent with those we have previously described in the mouse brain, expression of Crym in the rat brain was highly attenuated, or absent, in the claustrum, demarcating a nuclear boundary that extended considerably beyond the anterior apex of the striatum. In concordance, enriched expression of Gng2 was found in the claustrum, again extending equivalently rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. The expression of claustral marker genes is a highly effective tool in the verification of electrophysiological electrode placement. Electrophysiological recordings from within this Gng2 and Crym-defined boundary of the rostral claustrum support previous reports of a spatial map in the rostral claustrum.
Conclusions: It is now clear that the anatomical boundary of the rat claustrum does in fact extend into more frontal regions of the brain than has previously been asserted.

BasecRAWller: Streaming Nanopore Basecalling Directly from Raw Signal,"Marcus Stoiber, James Brown",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"All current nanopore basecalling applications begin with the segmentation of raw signal into discrete events, which are ultimately processed into called bases. We propose the basecRAWller algorithm, a pair of unidirectional recurrent neural networks that enables the calling of DNA bases in real time directly from the rawest form of nanopore output. This shift in nanopore basecalling provides a number of advantages over current processing pipelines including: 1) streaming basecalling, 2) tunable ratio of insertions to deletions, and 3) potential for streaming detection of modified bases. Key to the streaming basecalling capability is sequence prediction at a delay of less than 1/100th of a second, allowing future signal to continuously modulate sequence prediction. BasecRAWller is computationally efficient enabling basecalling at speeds faster than current nanopore instrument measurement speeds on a single core. Further, basecalling can be paused and resumed without any change in the resulting predicted sequence, transforming the potential applications for dynamic read rejection capabilities.

Moreover, by connecting two local circuits via cortico-cortical projections, the emergent
phase differences define a flexible and frequency-dependent inter-areal hierarchy. Such

Feed-forward and Feedback Control in Astrocytes for Ca2+-based Molecular Communications Nanonetworks," View ORCID ProfileMichael Taynnan Barros, Subhrakanti Dey",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Tripartite synapses involve a three-way communication process between a presynaptic neuron, a post-synaptic neuron and an astrocyte. Synapses plasticity depends on the gliotransmitters' concentration in the synaptic channel. And, an abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia and Depression. In this paper, a theoretical investigation of the cause of the abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters and how to achieve its control are presented through a Ca2+-signalling-based molecular communications framework. This communication system indeed enables indirect or remote control of gliotransmitters' regulation and spatial distribution inside the cellular tissue. This paper illustrates how a feed-forward and feedback control technique can manipulate IP3 values to stabilise the concentration of Ca2+ inside the astrocytes and, therefore, the influence gliotransmitters' concentration in the synaptic channel. The realisation of the presented methodology is envisioned as a synthetic biology approach that triggers IP3 production using a toggle switch circuit. The theoretical analysis of the given model aims i) to stabilize the Ca2+ concentration around a particular desired level in order to prevent abnormal gliotransmitters' concentration (extremely high or low concentration can result in neurodegeneration), ii) to improve the molecular communication performance that utilises Ca2+ signalling, and maintain gliotransmitters' regulation remotely. In the latter case, both the transmitter and receiver are engineered with an equaliser built from the presented control theory. It shows that the refractory periods from Ca2+ can be maintained to lower the noise propagation resulting in smaller time-slots for bit transmission, which can also improve the delay and gain performances. The proposed approach can potentially lead to novel nanomedicine solutions for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where a combination of nanotechnology and gene therapy approaches can be used to elicit the regulated Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes, ultimately improving neuronal activity.","['mbarros@tssg.org', 'Subhra.Dey@unisa.edu.au']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/18/177154,biorxiv,2017,5a491fa9-54ac-415f-b647-67b923e41946,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/18/177154.full.pdf
A Model for Brain Life History Evolution," View ORCID ProfileMauricio Gonzalez-Forero, Timm Faulwasser, Laurent Lehmann",Now published in PLOS Computational Biology. 2016,"Mathematical modeling of brain evolution is scarce, possibly due in part to the difficulty of describing how brain relates to fitness. Yet such modeling is needed to formalize verbal arguments and deepen our understanding of brain evolution. To address this issue, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brain's energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. Our model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated to the growth of brain and other tissues at each age under various biological settings as a result of natural selection. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a ``me-against-nature'' setting, namely when overcoming environmentally determined energy-extraction challenges does not involve any interactions with other individuals (possibly except caregivers), and using parameter values for modern humans. The uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny, as well as for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that (1) a me-against-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale, (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory, and (3) adult skill number is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills.

However, to extract the most relevant information from the acquired data, it is necessary to develop analysis methods with less ad hoc assumptions. To this end, brain rhythms are often used which are the specific frequency-bands of EEG signal and assumed to represent diverse sub-second cognitive processes at different parts of the cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic picture of ongoing and event-related activities of brain. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for the single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of brain is responsible to distinguish and respond appropriately to target versus standard events. By using EEG signal at the frontal cortex, we show that the α-band activity changes according to ″inhibition timing″ hypothesis and the β-band activity is in line with ″maintaining the status quo″ hypothesis.

We show here that grid cells offer a particularly rich opportunity for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of a cortical circuit, through a strategy based on global circuit perturbation combined with sparse neural recordings. The strategy is based on the theoretical insight that small perturbations of circuit activity will result in characteristic quantal shifts in the spatial tuning relationships between grid cells, which should be observable from multi-single unit recordings of a small subsample of the population. The predicted shifts differ qualitatively across candidate recurrent network mechanisms, and also distinguish between recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms. More generally, the proposed strategy demonstrates how sparse neu- ral recordings coupled with global perturbation in the grid cell system can reveal much more about circuit mechanism as it relates to function than can full knowledge of network activity or of the synaptic connectivity matrix.","['johnwidloski@gmail.com', 'ete@mail.clm.utexas.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/05/18/019224,biorxiv,2015,0bcf9ed1-48ac-4f64-b2c6-f9aae1164a9e,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/05/18/019224.full.pdf
TOP-DOWN FEEDBACK CONTROLS SPATIAL SUMMATION AND RESPONSE GAIN IN PRIMATE VISUAL CORTEX,"Lauri Nurminen, Sam Merlin, Marym Bijanzadeh, Frederick Federer, Alessandra Angelucci",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In the cerebral cortex, sensory information travels along feedforward connections through a hierarchy of areas processing increasingly complex stimulus features1. Hierarchical processing, based solely on feedforward connections, has dominated most theories of sensory processing in neuroscience and computer vision over the past 50 years. These theories, however, have disregarded the existence of anatomically more prominent feedback connections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas1, whose function remains hypothetical. Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Moreover, it is controversial whether feedback modulates response gain or surround suppression (the modulatory influence of sensory context on neuronal responses) in lower-order areas. Here we have performed the first specific inactivation of cortical feedback at millisecond-time resolution, by optogenetically inactivating feedback connections from the secondary (V2) to the primary visual cortex (V1) in primates. Moderate reduction of V2 feedback activity increased RF size and reduced surround suppression in V1, while strongly reducing feedback activity decreased response gain. Our study has identified a small set of fundamental operations as the cellular-level mechanisms of feedback-mediated top down modulations of early sensory processing. These operations allow the visual system to dynamically regulate spatial resolution, by changing RF size, its sensitivity to image features, by changing response gain, and efficiency of coding natural images, by providing surround suppression.","['alessandra.angelucci@hsc.utah.edu', 'alessandra.angelucci@hsc.utah.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/21/094680,biorxiv,2017,b9e9dfc9-54c6-49e9-95b5-c88479152cd0,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/21/094680.full.pdf

We added three sensorimotor impairments commonly associated with post-stroke hemiparesis - abnormal joint coupling, increased noise on internally modeled dynamics, and muscular weakness - and examined the impact on reaching performance. We found that abnormal joint coupling unknown to the system's internal model caused systematic perturbations to trajectories, longer reach durations, and target overshoot. Increasing internal model noise and muscular weakness had little impact on motor performance unless model noise was increased by several orders of magnitude. Many reaches performed by our perturbed models replicate features commonly observed in reaches by hemiparetic stroke survivors. The sensitivity to unmodeled abnormal joint coupling agrees with experimental findings that abnormal coupling (possibly related to internal model errors) is the main cause of post-stroke motor impairment.","['ssketch@stanford.edu', 'cssimps@stanford.edu', 'aokamura@stanford.edu', 'frederic.crevecoeur@uclouvain.be']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139857,biorxiv,2017,4fc952bf-5f44-45b2-a036-2466c23991ce,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139857.full.pdf

Active visual exploration by saccadic eye movements elicited similar transitions in thalamo-cortical interaction. These findings suggest a common network substrate of both spontaneous activity and active vision. Thus, neuromodulators may play a role in dynamically sculpting the patterns of thalamo-cortical functional interaction that underlie visual processing.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/08/135376,biorxiv,2017,990ded95-9db3-44b7-96fa-8c0ca71813e9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/08/135376.full.pdf
Hippocampal Spike-Timing Correlations Lead to Hexagonal Grid Fields,"Mauro M.

However, there is a paucity of tools available to investigate variants in sORF regions of the genome. Here we  investigate the performance of commonly used tools for variant calling and variant prioritisation in these regions, and present a framework for optimising these processes. First, the performance of four widely used germline variant calling algorithms is systematically compared. Haplotype Caller is found to perform best across the whole genome, but FreeBayes is shown to produce the most accurate variant set in sORF regions. An accurate set of variants is found by taking the intersection of called variants. The potential deleteriousness of each variant is then predicted using a pathogenicity scoring algorithm developed here, called sORF-c. This algorithm uses supervised machine-learning to predict the pathogenicity of each variant, based on a holistic range of functional, conservation-based and region-based scores defined for each variant. By training on a dataset of over 130,000 variants, sORF-c outperforms other comparable pathogenicity scoring algorithms on a test set of variants in sORF regions of the human genome.",['sp339@cam.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/03/133645,biorxiv,2017,01fa3a19-d1fd-4f7b-8487-089ef0720dc4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/03/133645.full.pdf

However, existing linear techniques for neural decoding may not fully reveal or exploit the fidelity of the neural signal. Here we develop a new approximate Bayesian method for decoding natural images from the spiking activity of  populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We sidestep known computational challenges with Bayesian inference by exploiting artificial neural networks developed for computer vision, enabling fast nonlinear decoding that incorporates natural scene statistics implicitly. We use a decoder architecture that first linearly reconstructs an image from RGC spikes, then applies a convolutional autoencoder to enhance the image. The resulting decoder, trained on natural images and simulated neural responses, significantly outperforms linear decoding, as well as simple point-wise nonlinear decoding. Additionally, the decoder trained on natural images performs nearly as accurately on a subset of natural stimuli (faces) as a decoder trained specifically for the subset, a feature not observed with a linear decoder. These results provide a tool for the assessment and optimization of retinal prosthesis technologies, and reveal that the neural output of the retina may provide a more accurate representation of the visual scene than previously appreciated.","['nikparth@gmail.com', 'erb2180@columbia.edu', 'waf2107@columbia.edu', 'tkr2112@columbia.edu', 'mr3522@columbia.edu', 'ej@stanford.edu', 'liam@stat.columbia.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/02/153759,biorxiv,2017,e48d9171-425c-4042-aead-eed2f282a5e6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/02/153759.full.pdf

We identify a prototypic response-time distribution, the gamma distribution, arising in both experimental data sets and mathematical models of signal-transduction pathways. We find that simple cell-to-cell communication circuits can generate bimodal response-time distributions, and can control synchronization and delay of cell-population responses independently.

Here, we report a previously unrecognized syndromic neonatal encephalopathy characterized by profound developmental disability, severe hypotonia, seizures, diminished respiratory drive requiring mechanical ventilation, brain atrophy, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphism. Biallelic inactivating mutations in TBCK (TBC1 domain-containing kinase) were independently identified by Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) as the cause of this condition in four unrelated families. Matching these families was facilitated by sharing phenotypic profiles and WES data in a recently released web-based tool (Geno2MP) that links phenotypic information to rare variants in families with Mendelian traits. TBCK is a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for small GTPases of the Rab family and has been shown to control cell growth and proliferation, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and mTOR signaling. Two of the three mutations are predicted to truncate the protein (c.376C>T [p.Arg126*] and c.1363A>T [p.Lys455*]), and loss of the major TBCK isoform was confirmed in primary fibroblasts from one affected individual. The third mutation, c.1532G>A [p.Arg511His], alters a conserved residue within the TBC1 domain. Structural analysis implicates Arg511 as a required residue for Rab-GAP function, and in silico homology modeling predicts impaired GAP function in the corresponding mutant. These results suggest loss of Rab-GAP activity is the underlying mechanism of disease. In contrast to other disorders caused by dysregulated mTOR signaling associated with focal or global brain overgrowth, impaired TBCK function results in progressive loss of brain volume.","['ddoher@uw.edu', 'marco.tartaglia@opbg.net']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/06/036111,biorxiv,2016,b68e2e91-cec8-443c-9476-cb25c3b45cc2,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/06/036111.full.pdf

We used intracellular recordings in rat neocortical brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms supporting persistent firing modes triggered by depolarizing stimuli following cholinergic receptor activation. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that a component of the underlying hyperexcitability associated with persistent firing reflects a reduction in the standing (leak) Kx current mediated by Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) channels. Three chemically diverse ERG channel blockers (terfenadine, ErgToxin-1, and E-4031) abolished persistent firing and the underlying increase in input resistance in deep pyramidal cells in temporal and prefrontal association neocortex. Calcium accumulation during triggering stimuli appear to attenuate ERG currents, leading to membrane potential depolarization and increased input resistance, two critical elements generating persistent firing. Our results also suggest that ERG current normally governs cortical neuron responses to depolarizing stimuli by opposing prolonged discharges and by enhancing the post-stimulus repolarization. The broad expression of ERG channels and the ability of ERG blocks to abolish persistent firing evoked by both synaptic and intracellular step stimuli suggests modulation of ERG channels may underlie many forms of persistent activity observed in vivo.",['bens@case.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/26/156075,biorxiv,2017,0334689b-81fa-4f7a-bd93-06e0d4723599,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/26/156075.full.pdf

Identification and quantitative analysis of the major determinants of translation elongation rate variation,"Khanh Dao Duc, Yun S. Song",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Ribosome profiling provides a detailed view into the complex dynamics of translation. Although the precise relation between the observed ribosome footprint densities and the actual translation elongation rates remains elusive, the data clearly suggest that elongation speed is quite heterogeneous along the transcript. Previous studies have shown that elongation is locally regulated by multiple factors, but the observed heterogeneity remains only partially explained.  To dissect quantitatively the different determinants of elongation speed, we here use probabilistic modeling to estimate transcript-specific initiation and local elongation rates from ribosome profiling data.  Using this model-based approach, we estimate the fraction of ribosomes (~9%) undetected by the current ribosome profiling protocol. These missing ribosomes come from regions harboring two or more closely-stacked ribosomes, and not accounting for them leads to a substantial underestimation of translation efficiency for highly occupied transcripts. We further quantify the extent of transcript- and position-specific interference between ribosomes on the same transcript, and infer that the movement of ~2.5% of ribosomes is obstructed on average, with substantial variation across different genes. The extent of interference also varies noticeably along the transcript sequence, with a moderately elevated level near the start site and a significantly pronounced amount near the termination site.  However, we show that neither ribosomal interference nor the distribution of slow codons is sufficient to explain the observed level of variation in the elongation rate. Instead, we find that electrostatic interaction between the ribosomal exit tunnel and specific parts of the nascent polypeptide governs the elongation rate variation as the polypeptide makes its initial pass through the tunnel.

A Deep Boosting Based Approach for Capturing the Sequence Binding Preferences of RNA-Binding Proteins from High-Throughput CLIP-Seq Data,"Shuya Li, Fanghong Dong, Yuexin Wu, Sai Zhang, Chen Zhang, Xiao Liu, Tao Jiang, Jianyang Zeng",Now published in Nucleic Acids Research. 2016,"Characterizing the binding behaviors of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important for understanding their functional roles in gene expression regulation. However, current high-throughput experimental methods for identifying RBP targets, such as CLIP-seq and RNAcompete, usually suffer from the false positive and false negative issues. Here, we develop a deep boosting based machine learning approach, called DeBooster, to accurately model the binding sequence preferences and identify the corresponding binding targets of RBPs from CLIP-seq data. Comprehensive validation tests have shown that DeBooster can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in predicting RBP targets and recover false negatives that are common in current CLIP-seq data. In addition, we have demonstrated several new potential applications of DeBooster in understanding the regulatory functions of RBPs, including the binding effects of the RNA helicase MOV10 on mRNA degradation, the influence of different binding behaviors of the ADAR proteins on RNA editing, as well as the antagonizing effect of RBP binding on miRNA repression. Moreover, DeBooster may provide an effective index to investigate the effect of pathogenic mutations in RBP binding sites, especially those related to splicing events. We expect that DeBooster will be widely applied to analyze large-scale CLIP-seq experimental data and can provide a practically useful tool for novel biological discoveries in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs.",['zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/10/086421,biorxiv,2016,8e965b04-e822-4d34-8b8f-16f95f1f54a1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/10/086421.full.pdf
Lognormal firing rate distribution reveals prominent fluctuation-driven regime in spinal motor networks,"Peter C. Petersen,  View ORCID ProfileRune W. Berg",Now published in eLife. 2016,"When spinal circuits generate rhythmic movements it is important that the neuronal activity remains within stable bounds to avoid saturation and to preserve responsiveness. In what dynamical regime does the neuronal population operate in order to achieve this? Here, we simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons in lumbar spinal circuits and establish the neuronal fraction that operates within either a 'mean driven' or a 'fluctuation driven' regime during generation of multiple motor behaviors. We find a rich diversity of firing rates across the neuronal population as reflected in a lognormal distribution and demonstrate that half of the neurons spend at least 50% of the time in the 'fluctuation driven' regime regardless of behavior. Since neurons in this regime have a 'supralinear' input/output curve, which enhances sensitivity, whereas the mean driven regime reduces sensitivity, this fraction may reflect a fine trade off between stability and sensitivity in order to maintain flexibility across motor behaviors.",['runeb@sund.ku.dk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/06/062257,biorxiv,2016,f82402fc-c7ca-4fa5-a85a-215a4c9ca875,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/06/062257.full.pdf
The evolution of alternative splicing in Drosophila,"Lauren Gibilisco, Qi Zhou, Shivani Mahajan, Doris Bachtrog",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (“AS”) greatly expands proteome diversity, but little is known about the evolutionary landscape of AS in Drosophila, and how it differs between embryonic and adult stages, or males and females. Here we study the transcriptome from several tissues and developmental stages in males and females from four species across the Drosophila genus. We find that 20-37% of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced. While males generally express a larger number of genes, AS is more prevalent in females, suggesting that the sexes adopt different expression strategies for their specialized function. While the number of total genes expressed increases during early embryonic development, the proportion of expressed genes that are alternatively spliced is highest in the very early embryo, before the onset of zygotic transcription. This indicates that females deposit a diversity of isoforms into the egg, consistent with abundant AS found in ovary. Cluster analysis by gene expression levels (“GE”) show mostly stage-specific clustering in embryonic samples, and tissue-specific clustering in adult tissues. Clustering embryonic stages and adult tissues based on AS profiles results in stronger species-specific clustering, and over development, samples segregate by developmental stage within species.  Most sex-biased AS found in flies is due to AS in gonads, with little sex-specific splicing in somatic tissues.","['lgibilisco@berkeley.edu', 'dbachtrog@berkeley.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/21/054700,biorxiv,2016,4408512c-37b1-4977-8883-6f1609838edf,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/21/054700.full.pdf
A systematic review of post-marital residence patterns in prehistoric hunter-gatherers,Devon D. Brewer,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Background and Rationale Post-marital residence patterns refer to where a couple lives after marriage, such as near or with husband's kin (patrilocality) or wife's kin (matrilocality).  These patterns influence other aspects of social organization and behavior, and potentially reveal key parts of human nature.  Since the 1860s, anthropologists have sought to characterize prehistoric hunter-gatherers' post-marital residence patterns by extrapolating from modern hunter-gatherers' and chimpanzees' behavior.  For many reasons, these extrapolations are invalid.  I summarized direct evidence of residence patterns from prehistoric hunter-gatherers' remains. Methods I conducted a systematic review of strontium isotope and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and extinct hominins.  I also carried out a systematic review of the reliability of classifying prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals by sex.  To evaluate assumptions underlying my analyses of residence patterns, I reviewed the ethnographic literature on hunter-gatherers' mortuary practices as represented in the eHRAF World Cultures database. Results The archaeologic sites included in my review represent every inhabited continent except Australia, and their dates span almost the last 10,000 years.  In the strontium isotope studies, most adults of both sexes were local, and women were slightly more likely to be local than men. Within sites, women and men had similar mtDNA distributions.  Women in neighboring, contemporaneous communities had somewhat distinct mtDNA distributions from each other, while the mtDNA distributions of men in the different communities were less distinguishable.  The statistical uncertainties for most summaries are fairly large.  Taken together, the results indicate the burial communities were mostly endogamous and that exogamous marriages strained toward matrilocality.  The very limited research on extinct hominins' residence patterns is consistent with these findings.  In addition, there was only a moderate correspondence between morphologic and genetic estimates of sex in adult prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals.  When I corrected for this measurement error or relied on genetic estimates of sex only, the post-marital residence pattern results shifted in the direction of greater matrilocal tendencies.  Modern hunter-gatherers' burial practices were consonant with the assumptions underlying my analyses. Conclusions Direct evidence from prehistoric hunter-gatherers' remains indicates very different post-marital residence patterns than those extrapolated from modern hunter-gatherers' and chimpanzees' behavior.   In prehistoric hunter-gatherer settings, endogamy may be the outcome of humans' long-term mating preferences.  Endogamy may have inhibited bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in prehistory and enabled the evolution of altruism in humans.",['dbrewer@interscientific.net'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/06/057059,biorxiv,2016,7f625fbf-460d-44c3-8a43-102cb6cd18e0,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/06/057059.full.pdf

However, MEG and EEG have systematic differences in sampling neural activity. This poses the question to which degree such measurement differences consistently bias the results of multivariate analysis applied to MEG and EEG activation patterns. To investigate, we conducted a concurrent MEG/EEG study while participants viewed images of everyday objects. We applied multivariate classification analyses to MEG and EEG data, and compared the resulting time courses to each other, and to fMRI data for an independent evaluation in space. We found that both MEG and EEG revealed the millisecond spatio-temporal dynamics of visual processing with largely equivalent results. Beyond yielding convergent results, we found that MEG and EEG also captured partly unique aspects of visual representations. Those unique components emerged earlier in time for MEG than for EEG. Identifying the sources of those unique components with fMRI, we found the locus for both MEG and EEG in high-level visual cortex, and in addition for MEG in early visual cortex.

There is evidence that entorhinal cortex enables neocortical neuroplasticity through cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing neocortical projections. Here we show that a CCKB antagonist blocks high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the auditory cortex, whereas local infusion of CCK induces LTP. CCK-/- mice lacked neocortical LTP and showed deficits in a cue-cue associative learning paradigm; administration of CCK rescued associative learning. HFS of CCK-containing entorhino-neocortical projection neurons in anesthetized mice enabled cue-cue associative learning. Furthermore, when one cue was pre-conditioned to footshock, the mouse showed a freezing response to the other cue, indicating that the mice had formed an association. HFS-induced neocortical LTP was completely blocked by either NMDA antagonist or CCK-BR antagonist, while application of either NMDA or CCK induced LTP after low-frequency stimulation (LFS).  Moreover, in the presence of CCK LTP was still induced, even after blockade of NMDA receptors. Local application of NMDA induced CCK release in the neocortex.  To identify how NMDA receptor switches LTP, a stimulation protocol of 25 pulse-pairs was adopted to replace HFS; NMDA-dependent LTP was induced with the inter-pulse intervals between 10 and 100 ms, but not with those of 5 and 200 ms. LTP-mediated plasticity was linked to localization of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2a on cortical CCK terminals originating in the entorhinal cortex.

Inference Of The Human Polyadenylation Code,"Michael Ka Kit Leung, Andrew Delong, Brendan J. Frey",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Processing of transcripts at the 3'-end involves cleavage at a polyadenylation site followed by the addition of a poly(A)-tail. By selecting which polyadenylation site is cleaved, alternative polyadenylation enables genes to produce transcript isoforms with different 3'-ends. To facilitate the identification and treatment of disease-causing mutations that affect polyadenylation and to understand the underlying regulatory processes, a computational model that can accurately predict polyadenylation patterns based on genomic features is desirable. Previous works have focused on identifying candidate polyadenylation sites and classifying sites which may be tissue-specific. What is lacking is a predictive model of the underlying mechanism of site selection, competition, and processing efficiency in a tissue-specific manner. We develop a deep learning model that trains on 3'-end sequencing data and predicts tissue-specific site selection among competing polyadenylation sites in the 3' untranslated region of the human genome. Two neural network architectures are evaluated: one built on hand-engineered features, and another that directly learns from the genomic sequence. The hand-engineered features include polyadenylation signals, cis-regulatory elements, n-mer counts, nucleosome occupancy, and RNA-binding protein motifs. The direct-from-sequence model is inferred without prior knowledge on polyadenylation, based on a convolutional neural network trained with genomic sequences surrounding each polyadenylation site as input. Both models are trained using the TensorFlow library. The proposed polyadenylation code can predict site selection among competing polyadenylation sites in different tissues. Importantly, it does so without relying on evolutionary conservation. The model can distinguish pathogenic from benign variants that appear near annotated polyadenylation sites in ClinVar and inspect the genome to find candidate polyadenylation sites. We also provide an analysis on how different features affect the model's performance.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/27/130591,biorxiv,2017,e59f6b2a-4225-41f9-b6a6-51ca0ac84027,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/27/130591.full.pdf

When doing so, the nervous system strongly suppresses sensory feedback for extended periods of time in comparison with the movement time. Why does the brain discard so much visual information? Here we suggest that perceptual suppression may arise from efficient sensorimotor computations, assuming that perception and control are fundamentally linked. More precisely, we show that a Bayesian estimator should reduce the weight of sensory information around the time of saccades, as a result of signal dependent noise and of sensorimotor delays. Such reduction parallels the behavioral suppression occurring prior to and during saccades, and the reduction in neural responses to visual stimuli observed across the visual hierarchy.

Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution, similar to the grand canonical ensemble in statistical physics, also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions.

Coupled with hippocampal theta activity, it allows the construction of a sleep scoring algorithm that relies on brain activity alone. This method reaches over 90% homology with classical methods based on muscular activity (EMG) and video tracking. Moreover, contrary to EMG, OB gamma power allows correct discrimination between sleep and immobility in ambiguous situations such as fear-related freezing. We use the instantaneous power of hippocampal theta oscillation and OB gamma oscillation to construct a 2D phase-space that is highly robust across mice and days. Dynamic analysis of trajectories within this space yields a novel characterization of sleep/wake and wake/sleep transitions as deeply divergent phenomena. Whereas waking up is a fast and direct transition, falling asleep is best described as stochastic and gradual change.

One of the next great challenges for studying human genetics will be to acknowledge and embrace complexity.  Every human is unique, and the study of human disease phenotypes (and phenotypes in general) will be greatly enriched by moving from a deterministic to a more stochastic/probabilistic model.  The dichotomous distinction between simple and complex diseases is completely artificial, and we argue instead for a model that considers a spectrum of diseases that are variably manifesting in each person. The rapid adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the Internet-mediated networking of people promise to yield more insight into this century-old debate. Comprehensive ancestry tracking and detailed family history data, when combined with WGS or at least cascade-carrier screening, might eventually facilitate a degree of genetic prediction for some diseases in the context of their familial and ancestral etiologies.  However, it is important to remain humble, as our current state of knowledge is not yet sufficient, and in principle, any number of nucleotides in the genome, if mutated or modified in a certain way and at a certain time and place, might influence some phenotype during embryogenesis or postnatal life.","['GholsonJLyon@gmail.com', 'jazon33y@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/10/06/000687,biorxiv,2014,d3cb73f9-7a28-418e-a759-4ef34dfcd527,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/10/06/000687.full.pdf

Decoding Single Molecule Time Traces with Dynamic Disorder,"Wonseok Hwang, Il-Buem Lee, Seok-Cheol Hong, Changbong Hyeon",Now published in PLOS Computational Biology. 2016,"Single molecule time trajectories of biomolecules provide glimpses into complex folding landscapes that are difficult to visualize using conventional ensemble measurements. Recent experiments and theoretical analyses have highlighted dynamic disorder in certain classes of biomolecules, whose dynamic pattern of conformational transitions is affected by slower transition dynamics of internal state hidden in a low dimensional projection. A systematic means to analyze such data is, however, currently not well developed. Here we report a new algorithm - Variational Bayes-double chain Markov model (VB-DCMM) - to analyze single molecule time trajectories that display dynamic disorder. The proposed analysis employing VB-DCMM allows us to detect the presence of dynamic disorder, if any, in each trajectory, identify the number of internal states, and estimate transition rates between the internal states as well as the rates of conformational transition within each internal state. Applying VB-DCMM algorithm to single molecule FRET data of H-DNA in 100 mM-Na+ solution, followed by data clustering, we show that at least 6 kinetic paths linking 4 distinct internal states are required to correctly interpret the duplex-triplex transitions of H-DNA.","['hyeoncb@kias.re.kr', 'hyeoncb@kias.re.kr']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092387,biorxiv,2016,8506ffa7-3e2b-42a3-97c4-c6bfd71a9de5,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092387.full.pdf
Deep-time parallel evolution of myrmecoid syndrome in rove beetle symbionts of army ants,"Munetoshi Maruyama, Joseph Parker",Now published in Current Biology. 2016,"Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence, but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, due to a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the world's tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking ""myrmecoid"" body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts' societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood. Here we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this novel adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least twelve times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host-specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distances - as much as 105 million years (My). All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, as army ants are proposed to have risen to ecological dominance. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic coevolution with army ants.",['jp2488@columbia.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/20/076315,biorxiv,2016,53c1b507-26d7-44a1-b283-333dec70b40e,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/20/076315.full.pdf
Computational prediction shines light on type III secretion origins,"Tatyana Goldberg, Burkhard Rost, Yana Bromberg",Now published in Scientific Reports. 2016,"Type III secretion system is a key bacterial symbiosis and pathogenicity mechanism responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, ranging from food borne illnesses to the bubonic plague. In many Gram negative bacteria, the type III secretion system transports effector proteins into host cells, converting resources to bacterial advantage. Here we introduce a computational method that identifies type III effectors by combining homology based inference with de novo predictions, reaching up to 3fold higher performance than existing tools. Our work reveals that signals for recognition and transport of effectors are distributed over the entire protein sequence instead of being confined to the N-terminus, as was previously thought. Our scan of hundreds of prokaryotic genomes identified previously unknown effectors, suggesting that type III secretion may have evolved prior to the archaea/bacteria split.

Adaptation in protein fitness landscapes is facilitated by indirect paths,"Nicholas C. Wu, Lei Dai, C. Anders Olson, James O. Lloyd-Smith, Ren Sun",Now published in eLife. 2016,"The structure of fitness landscapes is critical for understanding adaptive protein evolution (e.g. antimicrobial resistance, affinity maturation, etc.). Due to limited throughput in fitness measurements, previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, however, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20L, L being the length of the relevant sequence) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. To study how these features impact the course of protein evolution, we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in the IgG-binding domain of protein G, containing 204 = 160,000 variants. We found that the fitness landscape was rugged and direct paths of adaptation were often constrained by pairwise epistasis. However, while direct paths were blocked by reciprocal sign epistasis, we found systematic evidence that such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by ""extra-dimensional bypass"". Extra dimensions in sequence space - with a different amino acid at the site of interest or an additional interacting site - open up indirect paths of adaptation via gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on reaching high fitness genotypes via selectively accessible trajectories, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may completely change our views on how proteins evolve.",['RSun@mednet.ucla.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/22/045096,biorxiv,2016,717092cb-05b1-40ac-8fae-73150274a5ff,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/22/045096.full.pdf

General anesthetics abolish behavioural responsiveness in all animals, suggesting that the mechanisms involved are conserved. Studies in humans have shown that general anesthesia is characterized by distinct spectral signatures. We questioned whether anesthesia has similar effects on the Drosophila melanogaster brain. Using a multi-electrode technique we recorded Local Field Potentials from different areas of the fly brain simultaneously under increasing concentrations of isoflurane. Flickering visual stimuli ('frequency tags') allowed us to track evoked responses in the frequency domain. We found that isoflurane reduced power and coherence at the tagging frequency (13 or 17Hz) in central brain regions. Unexpectedly, isoflurane increased power and coherence at twice-the tag frequency in the optic lobes.

Measuring Protein Binding to Lipid Vesicles by Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy,"Daniela Kruger, Jan Ebenhan,  View ORCID ProfileKirsten Bacia",Now published in Biophysical Journal. 2017,"Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) has been previously used to investigate peptide and protein binding to lipid membranes, as it allows for very low amounts of sample, short measurement times and equilibrium binding conditions. Labeling only one of the binding partners however comes with certain drawbacks, as it relies on identifying binding events by a change in diffusion coefficient. Since peptide and protein aggregation can obscure specific binding and since non-stoichiometric binding necessitates the explicit choice of a statistical distribution for the number of bound ligands, we additionally label the liposomes and perform dual-color Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (dcFCCS). We develop a theoretical framework showing that dcFCCS amplitudes allow calculation of the degree of ligand binding and the concentration of unbound ligand, leading to a binding model-independent binding curve. As the degree of labeling of the ligands does not factor into the measured quantities, it is permissible to mix labeled and unlabeled ligand, thereby extending the range of usable protein concentrations and accessible dissociation constants KD. The total protein concentration, but not the fraction of labeled protein needs to be known. In this work, we apply our dcFCCS analysis scheme to Sar1p, a protein of the COPII complex, which binds “major-minor-mix” liposomes. A Langmuir isotherm model yields KD = (2.1 ± 1.1) μM as the single site dissociation constant. The dual-color FCCS framework presented here is highly versatile for biophysical analysis of binding interactions.

Microbial community composition and diversity via 16S rRNA gene amplicons: evaluating the Illumina platform,"Lucas Sinclair, Omneya Ahmed Osman, Stefan Bertilsson, Alexander Eiler",Now published in PLOS ONE. 2014,"As new sequencing technologies become cheaper and older ones disappear, laboratories switch vendors and platforms. Validating the new setups is a crucial part of conducting rigorous scientific research. Here we report on the reliability and biases of performing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We designed a protocol using 50 barcode pairs to run samples in parallel and coded a pipeline to process the data. Sequencing the same sediment sample in 248 replicates as well as 70 samples from alkaline soda lakes, we evaluated the performance of the method with regards to estimates of alpha and beta diversity.

Using different purification and DNA quantification procedures we always found up to 5-fold differences in the yield of sequences between individually barcodes samples. Using either a one-step or a two-step PCR preparation resulted in significantly different estimates in both alpha and beta diversity. Comparing with a previous method based on 454 pyrosequencing, we found that our Illumina protocol performed in a similar manner -- with the exception for evenness estimates where correspondence between the methods was low.

We further quantified the data loss at every processing step eventually accumulating to 50\% of the raw reads. When evaluating different OTU clustering methods, we observed a stark contrast between the results of QIIME with default settings and the more recent UPARSE algorithm when it comes to the number of OTUs generated. Still, overall trends in alpha and beta diversity corresponded highly using both clustering methods. 

Our procedure performed well considering the precisions of alpha and beta diversity estimates, with insignificant effects of individual barcodes. Comparative analyses suggest that 454 and Illumina sequence data can be combined if the same PCR protocol and bioinformatic workflows are used for describing patterns in richness, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition.

Ligation-anchored PCR unveils immune repertoire of TCR-beta from whole blood,"Fan Gao, Kai Wang",Now published in BMC Biotechnology. 2014,"Background
As one of the genetic mechanisms for adaptive immunity, V(D)J recombination generates an enormous repertoire of T-cell receptors (TCRs). With the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, systematic exploration of V(D)J recombination becomes possible. Multiplex PCR method has been previously developed to assay immune repertoire, however the usage of primer pools has inherent bias in target amplification. In our study, we developed a ligation-anchored PCR method to unbiasedly amplify the repertoire. 
Results
By utilizing a universal primer paired with a single primer targeting the conserved constant region, we amplified TCR-beta (TRB) variable regions from total RNA extracted from blood. Next-generation sequencing libraries were then prepared for Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer, which provided 151 bp read length to cover the entire V(D)J recombination region. We evaluated this approach on blood samples from patients with malignant and benign meningiomas. Mapping of sequencing data showed 64% to 91% of mapped TCRV-containing reads belong to TRB subtype. An increased usage of TRBV29-1 was observed in malignant meningiomas. Also distinct signatures were identified from CDR3 sequence logos, with predominant subset as 42 nt for benign and 45 nt for malignant samples, respectively.

Reverse-complement parameter sharing improves deep learning models for genomics,"Avanti Shrikumar, Peyton Greenside, Anshul Kundaje",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Deep learning approaches that have produced breakthrough predictive models in computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation are now being successfully applied to problems in regulatory genomics. However, deep learning architectures used thus far in genomics are often directly ported from computer vision and natural language processing applications with few, if any, domain-specific modifications. In double-stranded DNA, the same pattern may appear identically on one strand and its reverse complement due to complementary base pairing. Here, we show that conventional deep learning models that do not explicitly model this property can produce substantially different predictions on forward and reverse-complement versions of the same DNA sequence.

Resolving neuronal population code and coordination with gradient boosted trees,"Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem of neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction system, we present evidence how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised machine learning tool, learns the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. As an example, we show how the method reveals a temporally shifted coordination in a thalamo-cortical circuit during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.","['guillaume.viejo@mcgill.ca', 'adrien.peyrache@mcgill.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/13/148643,biorxiv,2017,69dea422-d33e-4944-bbec-b39dbdabc4aa,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/13/148643.full.pdf

However, people often gather information across these levels in parallel. For instance, even as they choose their actions, they may continue to evaluate how much to attend other tasks or dimensions of information within a task. We scanned participants while they made such parallel evaluations, simultaneously weighing how much to attend two dynamic stimulus attributes and which response to give based on the attended information. Regions of prefrontal cortex tracked information about the stimulus attributes in dissociable ways, related to either the predicted reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) or the degree to which that attribute was being attended (dorsal anterior cingulate, dACC). Within dACC, adjacent regions tracked uncertainty at different levels of the decision, regarding what to attend versus how to respond.

However, different human tissues, while inheriting a similar genetic code, exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties. Specific biochemical processes and associated biomolecules that differentiate various tissues are not completely understood, neither is the extent to which a unicellular organism, such as yeast, can be used to model these processes within each tissue. 

We propose a novel computational and statistical framework to systematically quantify the suitability of yeast as a model organism for different human tissues. We develop a computational method for dissecting the human interactome into tissue-specific cellular networks. Using these networks, we simultaneously partition the functional space of human genes, and their corresponding pathways, based on their conservation both across species and among different tissues. We study these sub-spaces in detail, and relate them to the overall similarity of each tissue with yeast. 

Many complex disorders are driven by a coupling of housekeeping (universally expressed in all tissues) and tissue-selective (expressed only in specific tissues) dysregulated pathways. We show that human-specific subsets of tissue-selective genes are significantly associated with the onset and development of a number of pathologies. Consequently, they provide excellent candidates as drug targets for therapeutic interventions.

Adaptive introgression from distant Caribbean islands contributed to the diversification of a microendemic radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes," View ORCID ProfileEmilie Jean Richards, Christopher Herbert Martin",Now published in PLOS Genetics. 2017,"Rapid diversification often involves complex histories of gene flow that leave variable and conflicting signatures of evolutionary relatedness across the genome. Identifying the extent and source of variation in these evolutionary relationships can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms involved in rapid radiations. Here we compare the discordant evolutionary relationships associated with species phenotypes across 42 whole genomes from a sympatric adaptive radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas and several outgroup pupfish species in order to understand the rarity of these trophic specialists within the larger radiation of Cyprinodon. 82% of the genome depicts close evolutionary relationships among the San Salvador Island species reflecting their geographic proximity, but the vast majority of the fixed variants between the specialist species lie in regions with discordant topologies. These regions include signatures of selective sweeps and adaptive introgression from neighboring islands into each of the specialist species. Hard selective sweeps of genetic variation on San Salvador contributed 10-fold more to divergence between specialist species within the radiation than adaptive introgression of Caribbean genetic variation; however, some of these introgressed regions from distant islands were associated with the primary axis of oral jaw divergence within the radiation. For example, standing variation in a proto-oncogene (ski) known to have effects on jaw size introgressed into one San Salvador specialist from an island 300 km away.  The complex emerging picture of the origins of adaptive radiation on San Salvador indicates that multiple sources of genetic variation contributed to the adaptive phenotypes of novel trophic specialists on the island. Our findings suggest that a suite of factors, including rare adaptive introgression, may also be required to trigger adaptive radiation in the presence of ecological opportunity.",['chmartin@unc.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/08/115055,biorxiv,2017,e7e099dc-1281-4eaa-9f2b-6a3f7194204f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/08/115055.full.pdf

To better understand such highly complex brain processes, modern neuroimaging studies are increasingly utilizing experimental setups that better mimic daily-life situations. We propose a new exploratory data-analysis approach, functional segmentation intersubject correlation analysis (FuSeISC), to
facilitate the analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data sets collected in these experiments. The method provides a new type of functional segmentation of brain areas, not only characterizing areas that display similar processing across subjects but also areas in which processing across subjects is highly variable. 

We tested FuSeISC using fMRI data sets collected during traditional block design stimuli (37 subjects) as well as naturalistic auditory narratives (19 subjects). The method identified spatially local and/or bilaterally symmetric clusters in several cortical areas, many of which are known to be processing the types of stimuli used in the experiments. The method is not only prominent for spatial exploration of large fMRI data sets obtained using naturalistic stimuli, but has other potential applications such as generation of a functional brain atlases including both lower- and higher-order processing areas.

Finally, as a part of FuSeISC, we propose a criterion-based sparsification of the shared nearest-neighbor graph for detecting clusters in noisy data.

Clustering these more versatile adults, while others are away hunting and gathering, provides a setup for assortative mating.  This can lengthen attention span, enhance versatility and, with it, brain size.  The rate of enlargement is accelerated by a boom-and-bust cycle in their meat supply, predicting the observed initiation of enlargement at -2.3 myr in the Rift Valley once boom-prone grazers evolved from the mixed feeders.  Several months after lightning created a burn scar back in the brush, the new grassland enables a population boom for those grazers that discover it.  Several decades later as brush regrows, they are pushed back.  Their hominin followers, wicked in from the grassland's shady fringe, boom together with the burn-scar grazers.  They then follow their meat supply back to the main population.  This creates an amplifying feedback loop, shifting Homo gene frequencies centrally.  Brush fires are so frequent that the cosmic ray mutation rate becomes enlargement's rate-limiter, consistent with 460 cm3/myr remaining constant during many climate shifts.  The apparent tripling of enlargement rate in the last 0.2 myr vanished when the non-ancestors were omitted.  Asian Homo erectus enlargement lags the ancestral trend line by 0.5 myr.

Modern machine learning techniques have the potential to perform better. Here we directly compared GLMs to three leading methods: feedforward neural networks, gradient boosted trees, and stacked ensembles that combine the predictions of several methods. We predicted spike counts in macaque motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices from reaching kinematics, and in rat hippocampal cells from open field location and orientation. In general, the modern methods produced far better spike predictions and were less sensitive to the preprocessing of features. XGBoost and the ensemble were the best-performing methods and worked well even on neural data with very low spike rates. This overall performance suggests that tuning curves built with GLMs are at times inaccurate and can be easily improved upon.

Efficient inference of recent and ancestral recombination within bacterial populations,"Rafal Mostowy, Nicholas J. Croucher, Cheryl P. Andam, Jukka Corander, William P. Hanage, Pekka Marttinen",Now published in Molecular Biology and Evolution. 2017,"Prokaryotic evolution is affected by horizontal transfer of genetic material through recombination. Inference of an evolutionary tree of bacteria thus relies on accurate identification of the population genetic structure and recombination-derived mosaicism. Rapidly growing databases represent a challenge for computational methods to detect recombinations in bacterial genomes. We introduce a novel algorithm called fastGEAR which identifies lineages in diverse microbial alignments, and recombinations between them and from external origins. The algorithm detects both recent recombinations (affecting a few isolates) and ancestral recombinations between detected lineages (affecting entire lineages), thus providing insight into recombinations affecting deep branches of the phylogenetic tree. In simulations, fastGEAR had comparable power to detect recent recombinations and outstanding power to detect the ancestral ones, compared to state-of-the-art methods, often with a fraction of computational cost. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analysing a collection of 616 whole-genomes of a recombinogenic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which the method provided a high-resolution view of recombination across the genome. We examined in detail the penicillin-binding genes across the Streptococcus genus, demonstrating previously undetected genetic exchanges between different species at these three loci. Hence, fastGEAR can be readily applied to investigate mosaicism in bacterial genes across multiple species.

To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models.

We show that, according to self-organizing models, if raised in a non-Euclidean hyperbolic cage rats should be able to form hyperbolic grids. For a given range of grid spacing relative to the radius of negative curvature of the hyperbolic surface, such grids are predicted to appear as multi-peaked firing maps, in which each peak has seven neighbours instead of the Euclidean six, a prediction that can be tested in experiments.

Scape elongation is believed to play an important role in the evolution of eusociality in ants; however, this hypothesis has never been confirmed statistically. The statistical analysis presented herein lends support to the view that antennal morphology reliably distinguishes stem-group ants from crown-group ants to determine whether a species belongs to one or the other group.

Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction methods are routinely used to reduce the computational burden of analyses. We therefore seek to address the question of whether it is possible to improve the efficiency of sequence alignment by applying dimensionality reduction methods to numerically represented nucleotide sequences. 
Results: To explore the applicability of signal transformation and dimensionality reduction methods to sequence assembly, we implemented a short read aligner and evaluated its performance against simulated high diversity viral sequences alongside four existing aligners. Using our sequence transformation and feature selection approach, alignment time was reduced by up to 14-fold compared to uncompressed sequences and without reducing alignment accuracy. Despite using highly compressed sequence transformations, our implementation yielded alignments of similar overall accuracy to existing aligners, outperforming all other tools tested at high levels of sequence variation. Our approach was also applied to the de novo assembly of a simulated diverse viral population.

"Topology, cross-frequency, and same-frequency band interactions shape the generation of phase-amplitude coupling in a neural mass model of a cortical column",Roberto Sotero,Now published in PLoS Computational Biology. 2016,"Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important indicator of information transmission in the brain. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable model of the phenomenon is that needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5, and L6). The conditional transfer entropies (cTE) from the phases to the amplitudes of the generated oscillations are estimated by means of the conditional mutual information. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g, theta-gamma or alpha-gamma) we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between them and, on average, did not depend upon the presence or absence of a direct (anatomical) connection. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more efficient when transmitting information. Since more than 60 % of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon.",['roberto.soterodiaz@ucalgary.ca'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/23/023291,biorxiv,2016,230dd018-76fb-49fd-8afe-38211344d2da,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/23/023291.full.pdf

In this work, we introduce the open-source Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness longitudinal processing pipeline and its application on the first phase of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months.

Paggi, Gill Bejerano",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Experimental detection of RNA splicing branchpoints, the nucleotide serving as the nucleophile in the first catalytic step of splicing, is difficult. To date, annotations exist for only 16-21% of 3' splice sites in the human genome and even these limited annotations have been shown to be plagued by noise. We develop a sequence-only, deep learning based branchpoint predictor, LaBranchoR, which we conclude predicts a correct branchpoint for over 90% of 3' splice sites genome-wide. Our predicted branchpoints show large agreement with trends observed in the raw data, but analysis of conservation signatures and overlap with pathogenic variants reveal that our predicted branchpoints are generally more reliable than the raw data itself. We use our predicted branchpoints to identify a sequence element upstream of branchpoints consistent with extended U2 snRNA base pairing, show an association between weak branchpoints and alternative splicing, and explore the effects of variants on branchpoints.","['jpaggi@stanford.edu', 'bejerano@stanford.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/07/185868,biorxiv,2017,ee5acf1e-7b9c-4166-a682-cb126593d2a3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/07/185868.full.pdf

In frontal cortex, however, neurons display baffling complexity, responding to a mixture of sensory, motor and other variables. Here we use  an integrated  new approach to understanding the architecture of higher-order cortical representations, and use this approach to show that discrete groups of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neurons encode distinct decision variables.

These categorical representations map directly onto decision-variables of a choice model explaining our behavioral data, such as reward size, decision confidence and integrated value.

Nonsinusoidal oscillations underlie pathological phase-amplitude coupling in the motor cortex in Parkinson's disease," View ORCID ProfileScott R Cole, Erik J Peterson, Roemer van der Meij, Coralie de Hemptinne, Philip A Starr, Bradley Voytek",Now published in The Journal of Neuroscience. 2016,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with abnormal beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) in the basal ganglia and motor cortex (M1). Recent reports show that M1 beta-high gamma (50-200 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is exaggerated in PD and is reduced following acute deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here we analyze invasive M1 electrocorticography recordings in PD patients on and off DBS, and in isolated cervical dystonia patients, and show that M1 beta oscillations are nonsinusoidal, having sharp and asymmetric features. These sharp oscillatory beta features underlie the previously reported PAC, providing an alternative to the standard interpretation of PAC as an interaction between two distinct frequency components. Specifically, the ratio between peak and trough sharpness is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma PAC (r = 0.96) and predicts PD-related motor deficit. Using a simulation of the local field potential, we demonstrate that sharp oscillatory waves can arise from synchronous synaptic activity. We propose that exaggerated beta-high gamma PAC may actually reflect such synchronous synaptic activity, manifesting as sharp beta oscillations that are ""smoothed out"" with DBS. These results support the ""desynchronization"" hypothesis of DBS wherein DBS counteracts pathological synchronization throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. We argue that PAC can be influenced by more than one mechanism. In this case synaptic synchrony, rather than the often assumed spike-field coherence, may underlie exaggerated PAC. These often overlooked temporal features of the oscillatory waveform carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics that may lead to better understanding of underlying neuropathology.",['srcole@ucsd.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/19/049304,biorxiv,2016,b95249b9-4b9c-452a-9fb4-80e4776f2a4c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/19/049304.full.pdf

While the 'omics' era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the 'omics' data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs.

Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential.

In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population while accounting for sequencing error by analyzing raw read from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequencing more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5x coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 2x coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding that with even a few high coverage individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans.

For some perturbations, ""outlier"" cells drove the increased variability. Bypass experiments that activated the PRS ectopically at downstream points indicated that microtubule-dependent processes might stabilize the membrane-recruited scaffold protein Ste5. The variability caused by microtubule perturbations required the MAP kinase Fus3. Microtubule perturbations hindered stable scaffold formation and decreased the accuracy of a polarity-dependent fate choice. Our experiments suggest that membrane-attached microtubules stabilize signaling by scaffold-bound Fus3, and are consistent with a model in which signaling irregularities from changes in microtubule function are amplified by cross-stimulatory feedbacks among PRS proteins.

Prioritizing 2nd order interactions via support vector ranking using sensitivity indices on time series Wnt measurements, View ORCID Profileshriprakash sinha,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors, that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For exam- ple, there are 19 types of WNTs and 10 FZDs with their 2nd order combinations high enough and it is not possible to know which one to test first (except for those for which wet lab validations have been confirmed). But the effect of these combinations vary over time as measurements of fold changes and deviations in fold changes vary. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative fea- tures. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>=2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy of prioritizing webpages us- ing ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. Recording the changing rankings of the combinations over time points and durations, reveals how higher order interactions behave within the pathway and when and where an intervention might be necessary to influence the pathway. This could lead to development of time based therapeutic interventions. Based on a small dataset in time, we were able to generate the rankings of the 2nd order combinations between WNTs and FZDs at different time snap shots and for different duration or time periods.

Accuracy of demographic inferences from Site Frequency Spectrum: The case of the Yoruba population,"Marguerite Lapierre, Amaury Lambert, Guillaume Achaz",Now published in Genetics. 2017,"Some methods for demographic inference based on the observed genetic diversity of current populations rely on the use of summary statistics such as the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS).

It is still debated whether demographic histories can be accurately inferred based on the SFS. Here we illustrate this theoretical issue on an example of demographic inference for an African population. The SFS of the Yoruba population (data from the 1000 Genomes Project) is fit to a simple model of population growth described with a single parameter (e.g., founding time). We infer a time to the most recent common ancestor of 1.7 million years for this population. However, we show that the Yoruba SFS is not informative enough to discriminate between several different models of growth.

Intriguingly, we observed that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries. Furthermore, a pan-cancer analysis revealed that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.","['Aristotelis.Tsirigos@nyumc.org', 'Ioannis.Aifantis@nyumc.org']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/30/141481,biorxiv,2017,4b1d4ffd-ce12-45d5-b85f-b2f7fef353d1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/30/141481.full.pdf

Computation of visual features depends on the types of photoreceptor neurons (PR) present, the organization of the eye and the wiring of the underlying neural circuit. Here, we describe the circuit architecture of the visual system of Drosophila larvae by mapping the synaptic wiring diagram and neurotransmitters. By contacting different targets, the two larval PR-subtypes create parallel circuits potentially underlying the computation of absolute light intensity and temporal light changes already within this first visual processing center. Locally processed visual information then signals via dedicated projection interneurons to higher brain areas including the lateral horn and mushroom body.

BinSanity: Unsupervised Clustering of Environmental Microbial Assemblies Using Coverage and Affinity Propagation," View ORCID ProfileElaina Graham, John Heidelberg,  View ORCID ProfileBenjamin Tully",Now published in PeerJ. 2016,"Metagenomics has become an integral part of defining microbial diversity in various environments. Many ecosystems have characteristically low biomass and few cultured representatives. Linking potential metabolisms to phylogeny in environmental microorganisms is important for interpreting microbial community functions and the impacts these communities have on geochemical cycles. However, with metagenomic studies there is the computational hurdle of binning contigs into phylogenetically related units or putative genomes. Binning methods have been implemented with varying approaches such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and two-way clustering; however, many of these suffer from biases against low coverage/abundance organisms and closely related taxa/strains. We are introducing a new binning method, BinSanity, that utilizes the clustering algorithm affinity propagation (AP), to cluster assemblies using coverage alone, removing potential composition based biases in clustering contigs, but requires a minimum of two samples. To increase fidelity, a refinement script was developed that uses composition data (tetranucleotide frequency and %G+C content) to refine bins containing multiple source organisms. This separation of composition and coverage based signatures reduces clustering bias for closely related taxa. BinSanity was developed and tested on artificial metagenomes varying in size and complexity. Results indicate that this implementation of AP lead to a higher precision, recall, and Adjusted Rand Index over five commonly implemented methods. When tested on a previously published infant gut metagenome, BinSanity generated high completion and low redundancy bins corresponding with the published metagenome-assembled genomes.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/16/069567,biorxiv,2016,2b657cbc-82a2-4eed-b147-8e1e3e7c5328,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/16/069567.full.pdf
Optical-flow analysis toolbox for characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics in mesoscale optical imaging of brain activity,"Navvab Afrashteh, Samsoon Inayat, Mostafa Mohsenvand, Majid Mohajerani",Now published in NeuroImage. 2016,"Wide-field optical imaging techniques constitute powerful tools to sample and study mesoscale neuronal activity. The sampled data constitutes a sequence of image frames in which one can perceive the flow of brain activity starting and terminating at source and sink locations respectively. The most common data analyses include qualitative assessment to identify sources and sinks of activity as well as their trajectories. The quantitative analyses is mostly based on computing the temporal variation of the intensity of pixels while a few studies have also reported estimates of wave motion using optical-flow techniques from computer vision. A comprehensive toolbox for the quantitative analyses of mesoscale brain activity data however is still missing. We present a graphical-user-interface based Matlab	® toolbox for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of mesoscale brain activity using optical-flow analyses. The toolbox includes the implementation of three optical-flow methods namely Horn-Schunck, Combined Local-Global, and Temporospatial algorithms for estimating velocity vector fields of perceived flow in mesoscale brain activity. From the velocity vector fields we determine the locations of sources and sinks as well as the trajectories and temporal velocities of activity flow. Using our toolbox, we compare the efficacy of the three optical-flow methods for determining spatiotemporal dynamics by using simulated data. We also demonstrate the application of optical-flow methods onto sensory-evoked calcium and voltage imaging data. Our results indicate that the combined local-global method we employ, yields results that correlate with the manual assessment.

Addiction in a Bounded Rational Model: Role of Environment and its Exploration," View ORCID ProfileDimitri Ognibene, Vincenzo Guido Fiore,  View ORCID ProfileXiaosi Gu",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Existing reinforcement learning (RL)  theories of addiction often rely on the 'dual-system theory of decision making'. This theory describes behaviour as a product of the interaction between a reactive, slowly adapting, model-free (MF) component, and a planning-oriented, flexible, and computationally demanding, model-based (MB), one. In addiction, the MF component is assumed to overtake the MB component, causing a behavioural shift towards aberrant reactive responses to drugs. RL theories ascribe this behavioural shift to substance induced bio-chemical effects, which are thought to hijack the standard temporal difference  learning mechanism regulating the MF component. However, MF processes seem to account mainly for simple, repetitive and compulsive behaviours so that existing RL models have limited power  in explaining: 1) the heterogeneity of drug seeking behaviours; 2) the different mechamisms of actions of the different drugs; 3)  addictive behaviours which are not associated with drug intake (e.g. gambling). In this paper, we propose that a non-simplistic experimental environment may account for such multifaceted phenomena in addiction, suggesting that heterogeneous addictive behaviours can arise also without modifications or malfunctions of the standard dual system. Environment complexity is often neglected in laboratory setups, despite its role in modulating the adaptation of both MF and MB components. In particular, environment complexity directly affects the MB decision process due to  bounded computational resources, and indirectly affects both the MB and MF learning processes, as exploration demands increase as a function of environment complexity. Thus, we employed an environment where highly rewarding actions are followed by several sparse undesired (punishing) effects, in a pattern that exceeds the computational capabilities of the agents. Our simulations show that the suboptimal decision to repeatedly pursue the high reward, despite its negative effects (i.e. addiction-like behaviour), emerges and is maintained for an extended period of time. This behaviour is found as a bifurcation in several individuals of uniform populations of dual-learning agents over a wide range of parameters regulating the interaction between MF and MB control modalities. Our simulations suggest that addiction may also arise independently of a pharmacological component (e.g. gambling and videogaming) under specific conditions of environment complexity.",['dimitri.ognibene@upf.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/23/179739,biorxiv,2017,723f3cc0-57a9-49e2-8191-a4e495c860ad,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/23/179739.full.pdf
Modeling Joint Abundance of Multiple Species Using Dirichlet Process Random Effects,"Devin Johnson, Elizabeth Sinclair",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"We present a method for modeling multiple species distributions simultaneously using Dirichlet Process random effects to cluster species into guilds. Guilds are ecological groups of species that behave or react similarly to some environmental conditions. By modeling latent guild structure, we capture the cross-correlations in abundance or occurrence of species over surveys. In addition, ecological information about the community structure is obtained as a byproduct of the model. By clustering species into similar functional groups, prediction uncertainty of community structure at additional sites is reduced over treating each species separately. The method is illustrated with a small simulation demonstration, as well as an analysis of a mesopelagic fish survey from the eastern Bering Sea near Alaska. The simulation data analysis shows that guild membership can be extracted as the differences between groups become larger and if guild differences are small the model naturally collapses all the species into a small number of guilds which increases predictive efficiency by reducing the number of parameters to that which is supported by the data.","['devin.johnson@noaa.gov', 'devin.johnson@noaa.gov', 'devin.johnson@noaa.gov', 'devin.johnson@noaa.gov']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/28/056150,biorxiv,2016,d21acb7f-1012-4b2a-9bb2-e5a10e62dc68,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/28/056150.full.pdf
Biogeographic dating of speciation times using paleogeographically informed processes,Michael J Landis,Now published in Systematic Biology. 2015,"Standard models of molecular evolution cannot estimate absolute speciation times alone, and require external calibrations to do so. Because fossil calibration methods rely on the unreliable fossil record, most nodes in the tree of life are dated with poor accuracy. However, many major paleogeographical events are dated, and since biogeographic processes depend on paleogeographical conditions, biogeographic dating may be used as an alternative or complementary method to fossil dating. I demonstrate how a time-stratified biogeographic stochastic process may be used to estimate absolute divergence times by conditioning on dated paleogeographical events. Informed by the current paleogeographical literature, I construct an empirical dispersal graph using 25 areas and 26 epochs for the past 540 Ma of Earth's history. Simulations indicate biogeographic dating performs well so long as paleogeography imposes constraint on biogeographic character evolution. To gauge whether biogeographic dating may have any practical use, I analyze the well-studied turtle clade (Testudines) then assess how well biogeographic dating fares compared to heavily fossil-calibrated dating results as reported in the literature. Fossil-free biogeographic dating estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant turtles to be approximately 201 Ma, which is consistent with fossil-based estimates. Accuracy improves further when including a root node fossil calibration.

We studied samples from the VITA brain bank and followed an extreme phenotypic ends study design comparing neuropathologically healthy aging individuals above 80 years of age with pure AD patients of the same age.

This variant lies on the autophagy and cell cycle associated TECPR2 gene. Autophagy dysfunction has been previously implicated in multiple progressive neurodegenerative diseases. An additional non-synonymous variant on the CINP gene (encoding a cell-cycle checkpoint protein) is also found in 46 percent of healthy controls and absent from all the AD cases. TECPR2 and CINP appear to be partner genes in terms of regulation and their associated transcription factors have been previously implicated in AD and neurodegeneration.

GOLabeler: Improving Sequence-based Large-scale Protein Function Prediction by Learning to Rank,"Ronghui You, Zihan Zhang, Yi Xiong, Fengzhu Sun, Hiroshi Mamitsuka, Shanfeng Zhu",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Motivation: Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used to annotate functions of proteins and understand their biological roles. Currently only <1% of more than 70 million proteins in UniProtKB have experimental GO annotations, implying the strong necessity of automated function prediction (AFP) of proteins, where AFP is a hard multi-label classification problem due to one protein with a diverse number of GO terms. Most of these proteins have only sequences as input information, indicating the importance of sequence-based AFP (SAFP: sequences are the only input). Furthermore, homology-based SAFP tools are competitive in AFP competitions, while they do not necessarily work well for so-called difficult proteins, which have <60% sequence identity to proteins with annotations already. Thus, the vital and challenging problem now is to develop a method for SAFP, particularly for difficult proteins.  Methods: The key of this method is to extract not only homology information but also diverse, deep-rooted information/evidence from sequence inputs and integrate them into a predictor in an efficient and also effective manner. We propose GOLabeler, which integrates five component classifiers, trained from different features, including GO term frequency, sequence alignment, amino acid trigram, domains and motifs, and
biophysical properties, etc., in the framework of learning to rank (LTR), a new paradigm of machine learning, especially powerful for multi-label classification.

A network of inhibition is critical for regulating plasticity in adulthood, yet contributions of interneuron types other than parvalbumin (PV) interneurons have been underexplored. Here we show Lypd6, an endogenous positive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), as a specific molecular target in somatostatin (SST) interneurons for reactivating cortical plasticity in adulthood. Selective overexpression of Lypd6 in adult SST interneurons reactivates plasticity through the α2 subtype of nAChR by rapidly activating SST interneurons and in turn inhibiting sub-population of PV interneurons, a key early trigger of the juvenile form of plasticity. Chemogenetic activation of SST interneurons confirms the causal role of SST interneuron activity in reactivating plasticity. Collectively, we identify the Lypd6-nAChRα2 system and associated SST-PV disinhibitory microcircuit as the novel SST interneuron-specific targets for reactivating plasticity in adulthood.

After a brief overview of how deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), a deep learning approach, can be adapted to SNP data in principle, we specifically present a way to alleviate the dimensionality problem by partitioned learning. We propose a sparse regression approach to coarsely screen the joint distribution of SNPs, followed by training several DBMs on SNP partitions that were identified by the screening. Aggregate features representing SNP patterns and the corresponding SNPs are extracted from the DBMs by a combination of statistical tests and sparse regression. In simulated case-control data, we show how this can uncover complex SNP patterns and augment results from univariate approaches, while maintaining type 1 error control. Time-to-event endpoints are considered in an application with acute myeloid lymphoma patients, where SNP patterns are modeled after a pre-screening based on gene expression data. The proposed approach identified three SNPs that seem to jointly influence survival in a validation data set.

However, human subjects have considerable variation in cortical folding, and in the location of functional areas relative to these folds. This makes alignment of cortical areas a challenging problem. The Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) tool is a flexible, spherical registration approach that enables accurate registration of surfaces based on a variety of different features. Using MSM, we have previously shown that driving cross-subject surface alignment, using areal features, such as resting state-networks and myelin maps, improves group task fMRI statistics and map sharpness. However, the initial implementation of MSM's regularisation function did not penalize all forms of surface distortion evenly. In some cases, this allowed peak distortions to exceed neurobiologically plausible limits unless regularisation strength was increased to a level which prevented the algorithm from fully maximizing surface alignment.   Here we propose and implement a new regularisation penalty, derived from physically relevant equations of strain (deformation) energy, and demonstrate that its use leads to improved and more robust alignment of multimodal imaging data. In addition, since spherical warps incorporate projection distortions that are unavoidable when mapping from a convoluted cortical surface to the sphere, we also propose constraints that enforce smooth deformation of cortical anatomies.

Boevink,  View ORCID ProfileEdgar Huitema",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2013,"Phytophthora spp. secrete vast arrays of effector molecules upon infection. A main class of intracellular effectors are the CRNs. They are translocated into the host cell and specifically localise to the nucleus where they are thought to perturb many different cellular processes. Although CRN proteins have been implicated as effectors, direct evidence of CRN mediated perturbation of host processes has been lacking. Here we show that a conserved CRN effector from P. capsici directly binds to tomato transcription factor SlTCP14-2. Previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that transcription factor TCP14 may be key immune signalling protein, targeted by effectors from divergent species. We extend on our understanding of TCP targeting by pathogen effectors by showing that the P. capsici effector CRN12_997 binds to SlTCP14-2 in plants. SlTCP14-2 over-expression enhances immunity to P. capsici, a phenotypic outcome that can be abolished by co-expression of CRN12_997. 
We show that in the presence of CRN12_997, SlTCP14-2 association with nuclear chromatin is diminished, resulting in altered SlTCP14 subnuclear localisation. These results suggest that CRN12_997 prevents SlTCP14 from positively regulating defence against P. capsici.  Our work demonstrates a direct interaction between an oomycete CRN and a host target required for suppression of immunity.

Metacognitive ability predicts hippocampal and prefrontal microstructure," View ORCID ProfileMicah Allen, James C Glen, Daniel Mullensiefen, D. Sam Schwarzkopf, Martina F.

Previous research suggests individuals vary substantially in their level of insight, and that this variation predicts brain volume and function, particularly in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, as qualitative, macroscopic measures such as brain volume can be related to a variety of microstructural features. Here we used a newly developed, high-resolution multi-parameter mapping technique in 48 healthy individuals to delineate quantitative markers of in vivo histological features underlying metacognitive ability. Specifically, we examined how neuroimaging markers of local grey matter myelination, macromolecular and iron content relate to insight. Extending previous volumetric findings, we found that metacognitive ability, as determined by a signal-detection theoretic model, was positively related to the myelo-architectural integrity of aPFC grey matter. Interestingly, perceptual metacognition predicted decreased macromolecule content coupled with increased iron in the hippocampus and precuneus, areas previously implicated in meta-memory rather than meta-perception. Further, the relationship of hippocampal-precuneus and prefrontal microstructure to an auditory memory measure was respectively mediated or suppressed by metacognitive ability, suggesting a dynamic trade-off between participant's memory and metacognition.

ssHMM: Extracting intuitive sequence-structure motifs from high-throughput RNA-binding protein data,"David Heller, Ralf Krestel, Uwe Ohler, Martin Vingron, Annalisa Marsico",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role in RNA post-transcriptional regulation and recognize target RNAs via sequence-structure motifs. To which extent RNA structure influences protein binding in the presence or absence of a sequence motif is still poorly understood. Existing RNA motif finders either take the structure of the RNA only partially into account, or produce models which are not directly interpretable as sequence-structure motifs. Thus, a tool which produces informative motifs and at the same time captures the relationship between RNA primary sequence and secondary structure is missing.

We developed ssHMM, an RNA motif finder that combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gibbs sampling to learn the joint sequence and structure binding preferences of RBPs from high-throughput data, such as CLIP-Seq sequences, and intuitively visualizes them as a graph. Evaluations on synthetic data showed that ssHMM reliably recovers fuzzy sequence motifs in 80 to 100% of the cases, outperforming state-of-the-art methods designed for a similar task. On real data, it produces motifs with higher information content than existing tools. Additionally, ssHMM is considerably faster than other methods on large data sets.

DeepARG: A deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data,"Gustavo A. Arango-Argoty, Emily Garner, Amy Pruden, Lenwood S. Heath, Peter Vikesland, Liqing Zhang",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Growing concerns regarding increasing rates of antibiotic resistance call for global monitoring efforts. Monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is of particular interest as these media can serve as sources of potential novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as hot spots for ARG exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequence-based monitoring has recently enabled direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are identified or predicted based on the best hits of homology searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach tends to produce high rates of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep leaning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two models, deepARG-SS and deepARG-LS, were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences, respectively. Performance evaluation of the deep learning models over 30 classes of antibiotics demonstrates that the deepARG models can predict ARGs with both high precision (>0.97) and recall (>0.90) for most of the antibiotic resistance categories. The models show advantage over the traditional best hit approach by having consistently much lower false negative rates and thus higher overall recall (>0.9). As more data become available for under-represented antibiotic resistance categories, the deepARG models performance can be expected to be further enhanced due to the nature of the underlying neural networks. The deepARG models are available both in command line version and via a Web server at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/deeparg.

ConDock predicts that all four ligands bind to the same location on GPER, centered on L119, H307, and N310; this site is deeper in the receptor cleft than are ligand binding sites predicted by previous studies.

Cleanliness in context: reconciling hygiene with a modern microbial perspective,"Roo Vandegrift, Ashley C Bateman, Kyla N Siemens, May Nguyen, Jessica L Green, Kevin G Van Den Wymelenberg,  View ORCID ProfileRoxana J Hickey",Now published in Microbiome. 2016,"The concept of hygiene is rooted in the relationship between cleanliness and the maintenance of good health. Since the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has become increasingly conflated with that of sterilization. Recent research on microbial ecology is demonstrating that humans have intimate and evolutionarily significant relationships with a diverse assemblage of microorganisms (our microbiota). Human skin is home to a diverse, skin-habitat specific community of microorganisms; this includes members that exist across the ecological spectrum from pathogen through commensal to mutualist. Most evidence suggests that the skin microbiota is likely of direct benefit to the host, and only rarely exhibits pathogenicity. This complex ecological context suggests that the conception of hygiene as a unilateral reduction or removal of microbes has outlived its usefulness. As such, we suggest the explicit definition of hygiene as 'those actions and practices that reduce the spread or transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, and thus reduce the incidence of disease'. To examine the implications of this definition, we review the literature related to hand drying as an aspect of hand hygienic practice. Research on hand drying generally focuses on 'hygienic efficacy', a concept not typically defined explicitly, but nearly always including alterations to bulk microbial load. The corresponding literature is differentiable into two divisions: research supporting the use of forced air dryers, which typically includes effectiveness of drying as an aspect of hygienic efficacy; and research supporting the use of paper towels, which typically includes risk of aerosolized spread of microbes from hands as an aspect of hygienic efficacy. Utilizing a definition of hygiene that explicitly relies on reduction in disease spread rather than alterations to bulk microbial load would address concerns raised on both sides of the debate. Future research should take advantage of cultivation-independent techniques, working to bridge the gap between the two existing divisions of research by using health outcomes (such as the spread of disease) as dependent variables, taking into account the microbial community context of the skin microbiota, and focusing on understanding the relative contribution of bioaerosols and residual moisture to the risk of disease transmission.","['awv@uoregon.edu', 'abateman@uoregon.edu', 'kylam@uoregon.edu', 'mayn@uoregon.edu', 'jlgreen@uoregon.edu', 'kevinvdw@uoregon.edu', 'rhickey@uoregon.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/20/095745,biorxiv,2016,6889f4a4-71aa-4469-9368-657e465e563b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/20/095745.full.pdf

IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3′ UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins.

We demonstrated that a network representing 3D structural similarities among 5,452 compounds can be used to automatically group together drugs with similar scaffolds and mode-of-action. We then compared the structural network to a network representing transcriptional similarities among a subset of 1,309 drugs for which transcriptional response were available in the Connectivity Map dataset. Analysis of structurally similar, but transcriptionally different, drugs sharing the same mode of action (MOA) enabled us to detect and remove weak and noisy transcriptional responses, greatly enhancing the reliability and usefulness of transcription-based approaches to drug discovery and drug repositioning. Analysis of transcriptionally similar, but structurally different drugs with unrelated MOA, led us to the identification of a toxic transcriptional signature indicative of lysosomal stress (lysosomotropism) and lipid accumulation (phospholipidosis) partially masking the target-specific transcriptional effects of these drugs. We further demonstrated by High Content Screening that this transcriptional signature is caused by the activation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy.

LIMIX enables to flexibly adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study designs.

Here we report an increase in the stabilization of dendritic spines formed during repetitive motor learning in the mouse model of MECP2-duplication syndrome, a high-penetrance form of syndromic autism. This increased stabilization is mediated entirely by spines that form cooperatively in clusters. The number of clusters formed and stabilized predicts the mutant's enhanced motor learning and memory phenotype, reminiscent of savant-like behaviors occasionally associated with autism. The ERK signaling pathway, which promotes cooperative plasticity between spines, was found to be hyperactive in MECP2-duplication motor cortex specifically after training.

Plasticity-Driven Self-Organization under Topological Constraints Accounts for Non-Random Features of Cortical Synaptic Wiring.,"Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch",Now published in PLOS Computational Biology. 2016,"Understanding the structure and dynamics of cortical connectivity is vital to understanding cortical function. Experimental data strongly suggest that local recurrent connectivity in the cortex is significantly non-random, exhibiting, for example, above-chance bidirectionality and an overrepresentation of certain triangular motifs. Additional evidence suggests a significant distance dependency to connectivity over a local scale of a few hundred microns, and particular patterns of synaptic turnover dynamics, including a heavy-tailed distribution of synaptic efficacies, a power law distribution of synaptic lifetimes, and a tendency for stronger synapses to be more stable over time. Understanding how many of these non-random features simultaneously arise would provide valuable insights into the development and function of the cortex. While previous work has modeled some of the individual features of local cortical wiring, there is no model that begins to comprehensively account for all of them. We present a spiking network model of a rodent Layer 5 cortical slice which, via the interactions of a few simple biologically motivated intrinsic, synaptic, and structural plasticity mechanisms, qualitatively reproduces these non-random effects when combined with simple topological constraints. Our model suggests that mechanisms of self-organization arising from a small number of plasticity rules provide a parsimonious explanation for numerous experimentally observed non-random features of recurrent cortical wiring. Interestingly, similar mechanisms have been shown to endow recurrent networks with powerful learning abilities, suggesting that these mechanism are central to understanding both structure and function of cortical synaptic wiring.",['miner@fias.uni-frankfurt.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/08/027268,biorxiv,2016,17e0dbce-319f-44b8-b62d-bc7527b55ce8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/08/027268.full.pdf

Such a family of strings, which we dub stringomes, is formalized in terms of a multi-partite directed acyclic graph with a source and a sink. The most interesting property of stringomes is probably the fact that they can be represented efficiently with compression up to their k-th order empirical entropy, while ensuring that the compression does not hinder the pattern-matching counting and reporting queries  either internal to a block or spanning two (or a few constant) adjacent blocks.

High-resolution TADs reveal DNA sequences underlying genome organization in flies,"Fidel Ramirez, Vivek Bhardwaj, Jose Villaveces, Laura Arrigoni, Bjoern A Gruening, Kin Chung Lam, Bianca Habermann, Asifa Akhtar, Thomas Manke",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Eukaryotic chromatin is partitioned into domains called TADs that are broadly conserved between species and virtually identical among cell types within the same species. Previous studies in mammals have shown that the DNA binding protein CTCF and cohesin contribute to a fraction of TAD boundaries. Apart from this, the molecular mechanisms governing this partitioning remain poorly understood. Using our new software, HiCExplorer,  we annotated high-resolution (570 bp) TAD boundaries in flies and identified eight DNA motifs enriched at boundaries. Known insulator proteins bind five of these motifs while the remaining three motifs are novel. We find that boundaries are either at core promoters of active genes or at non-promoter regions of inactive chromatin and that these two groups are characterized by different sets of DNA motifs. In contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is only present on 2% of boundaries in flies. Most boundaries are present at  divergent promoters of constitutively expressed genes and the gene expression tends to be coordinated within TADs. We demonstrate that boundaries can be accurately predicted using only the motif sequences, along with open chromatin, suggesting that DNA sequence encodes the 3D genome architecture in flies.

Interpretable per Case Weighted Ensemble Method for Cancer Associations,"Adrin Jalali, Nico Pfeifer",Now published in BMC Genomics. 2014,"Motivation: Molecular measurements from cancer patients such as gene expression and DNA methylation are usually very noisy. Furthermore, cancer types can be very heterogeneous. Therefore, one of the main assumptions for machine learning, that the underlying unknown distribution is the same for all samples, might not be completely fullfilled. We introduce a method, that can estimate this bias on a per-feature level and incorporate calculated feature confidences into a weighted combination of classifiers with disjoint feature sets.
Results: The new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many different cancer data sets with measured DNA methylation or gene expression. Moreover, we show how to visualize the learned classifiers to find interesting associations with the target label. Applied to a leukemia data set we find several ribosomal proteins associated with leukemia's risk group that might be interesting targets for follow-up studies and support the hypothesis that the ribosomes are a new frontier in gene regulation.

Typically read annotation is performed by a single alignment-based search tool such as BLAST. However, due to the vast extent of bacterial diversity, these approaches tend to be highly error prone, particularly for taxonomic assignments. Here we introduce a novel program for generating taxonomic assignments, called Gist, which integrates information from a number of machine learning methods and the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Uniquely Gist establishes the most appropriate weightings of methods for individual genomes, facilitating high classification accuracy on next-generation sequencing reads. We validate our approach using a synthetic metatranscriptome generator based on Flux Simulator, termed Genepuddle. Further, unlike previous taxonomic classifiers, we demonstrate the capacity of composition-based techniques to accurately inform on taxonomic origin without resorting to longer scanning windows that mimic alignment-based methods.

One goal of such work is to provide an integrated understanding of genome and phenotype evolution. Most comparative functional genomic studies have relied on multiple pairwise comparisons between species, an approach that does not incorporate information about the evolutionary relationships among species. The statistical problems that arise from not considering these relationships can lead pairwise approaches to the wrong conclusions, and are a missed opportunity to learn about biology that can only be understood in an explicit phylogenetic context. Here we examine two recently published studies that compare gene expression across species with pairwise methods, and find reason to question the original conclusions of both. One study interpreted pairwise comparisons of gene expression as support for the ortholog conjecture, the hypothesis that orthologs tend to be more similar than paralogs. The other study interpreted pairwise comparisons of embryonic gene expression across distantly related animals as evidence for a distinct evolutionary process that gave rise to phyla. In each study, distinct patterns of pairwise similarity among species were originally interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary processes, but instead we find they reflect species relationships. These reanalyses concretely demonstrate the inadequacy of pairwise comparisons for analyzing functional genomic data across species.

In this study we addressed this question, submitting ELA2KO and wild-type (WT) mice to several models sensitive to anxiety- and depression-like, memory, and repetitive behaviors. Our data indicates a higher incidence of barbering behavior in ELA2KO compared to WT, as well as an anxiogenic phenotype, evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM). While a decrease in locomotor activity was observed in ELA2KO in EPM, this feature was not the main source of variation in the other parameters analyzed. The marble burying test (MBT) indicated increase in repetitive behavior, observed by a higher number of buried marbles. The actimeter test indicated a decrease in total activity and confirmed the increase in repetitive behavior. The spatial memory was tested by repeated exposure to the actimeter in a 24h interval. Both ELA2KO and WT exhibited decreased activity compared to the first exposure, without any distinction between the genotypes. However, when submitted to the cued fear conditioning, ELA2KO displayed lower levels of freezing behavior in the extinction session when compared to WT, but no difference was observed during the conditioning phase. Increased levels of BDNF were found in the prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampus of ELA2KO mice compared to WT. Finally, in silico analysis indicates that ELA2 is putatively able to cleave BDNF, and incubation of the purified enzyme with BDNF led to the degradation of the later.

Identifying the genetic determinants of particular phenotypes in microbial genomes with very small training sets,"George S. Long, Mohammed Hussen, Jonathan Dench, Stephane Aris-Brosou",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: Machine learning (ML) encompasses a large set of algorithms that aim at discovering complex patterns between elements within large data sets without any prior assumptions or modeling. However, some scientific disciplines still produce small data sets: in particular, empirical studies that try to link complex phenotypes such as virulence or drug resistance to individual sets of protein-coding genes (proteomes) typically have very small sample sizes. To date, it is unknown how ML performs in such cases.  Results: To address this question, we evaluated the performance of adaptive boosting, a general ML classifier, on two data sets containing both the phenotype and the complete proteome of a small number of individuals. To assess the impact of proteome size, we contrasted a small genome (a virus: influenza) with a larger one (a bacterium: Pseudomonas). In order to analyze large proteomes, we developed a chunking algorithm. With the influenza data, we were able to rediscover amino acid sites experimentally implicated in three different complex phenotypes (infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity). However, results for the much larger pseudomonas proteome, pertaining to three types of drug resistance (Ciprofloxacin, Ceftazidime, and Gentamicin), proved unstable, depended on a number of assumptions, and were not always biologically sensible.  Conclusions: Our results show that ML algorithms such as adaptive boosting can be used to successfully identify the genetic determinants of microbes with small proteomes (viruses). Our chunking algorithm improved runtimes by an order of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy. Yet we found that the size of bacterial proteomes pushed ML to its limits in the face of small number of individuals. The use of these algorithms should probably be limited to preliminary or exploratory analysis, as long as both phenotyping and sequencing are too costly to perform on more individuals.",['sarisbro@uottawa.ca'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/26/181222,biorxiv,2017,69a28538-f6ab-4fdc-9a75-105e53a871b3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/26/181222.full.pdf

Gene tree discordance causes apparent substitution rate variation,"Fabio K. Mendes, Matthew W. Hahn",Now published in Systematic Biology. 2015,"Substitution rates are known to be variable among genes, chromosomes, species, and lineages due to multifarious biological processes. Here we consider another source of substitution rate variation due to a technical bias associated with gene tree discordance, which has been found to be rampant in genome-wide datasets, often due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). This apparent substitution rate variation is caused when substitutions that occur on discordant gene trees are analyzed in the context of a single, fixed species tree. Such substitutions have to be resolved by proposing multiple substitutions on the species tree, and we therefore refer to this phenomenon as ""SPILS"" (Substitutions Produced by Incomplete Lineage Sorting). We use simulations to demonstrate that SPILS has a larger effect with increasing levels of ILS, and on trees with larger numbers of taxa. Specific branches of the species trees are consistently, but erroneously, inferred to be longer or shorter, and we show that these branches can be predicted based on discordant tree topologies. Moreover, we observe that fixing a species tree topology when performing tests of positive selection increases the false positive rate, particularly for genes whose discordant topologies are most affected by SPILS. Finally, we use data from multiple Drosophila species to show that SPILS can be detected in nature. While the effects of SPILS are modest per gene, it has the potential to affect substitution rate variation whenever high levels of ILS are present, particularly in rapid radiations. The problems outlined here have implications for character mapping of any type of trait, and for any biological process that causes discordance. We discuss possible solutions to these problems, and areas in which they are likely to have caused faulty inferences of convergence and accelerated evolution.","['fkmendes@indiana.edu', 'mwh@indiana.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/18/029371,biorxiv,2015,1c48d15d-d035-4272-a962-c50f36f85f46,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/18/029371.full.pdf

Additionally, we show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time-scale of complete hotspot turnover. We quantified the variation in the biased distribution of recombination rates towards recombination hotspots across great apes. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10‐15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected.

Among the 1,411,234 and 53,546 full-length bacterial and archaeal sequences sequences, 94.5% and 95.1% of the bacterial and archeaeal sequences, respectively, belonged to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that have been observed more than once.

Thus, there is still considerable microbial diversity to be explored. Unfortunately, the rate of new full-length sequences has been declining and new sequences are primarily being deposited by a small number of studies. Furthermore, sequences from soil and aquatic environments, which are known to be rich in bacterial diversity, only represent 7.8 and 16.5% of the census while sequences associated with zoonotic environments represent 55.0% of the census.

Towards an Unconscious Neurotherapy for Common Fears,"Vincent Taschereau-Dumouchel, Aurelio Cortese, Toshinori Chiba, J. D. Knotts, Mitsuo Kawato, Hakwan Lau",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Can evolutionarily ""hardwired"" fear responses, e.g. for spiders and snakes, be reprogramed unconsciously in the human brain? Currently, exposure therapy is amongst the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders, but this intervention is subjectively aversive to patients, and rates of premature attrition from treatment have been reported to be as high as 70%. Here we introduce a novel method to bypass the subjective unpleasantness in conscious exposure, by directly pairing monetary reward with unconscious occurrences of decoded representations of naturally feared objects in the brain. The typical way to identify multivoxel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) representations for feared objects involves repeated presentations of the relevant images explicitly to subjects. However, for our potential treatment method to be effective in actual clinical settings, we need to decode fear representations without triggering excessively aversive reactions which may cause patients to dropout from treatments prematurely. Here we overcome this challenge by capitalizing on recent advancements in fMRI decoding techniques: We employed a method called hyperalignment to infer the relevant representations of feared objects for a designated participant based on data from other ""surrogate"" participants. This way the procedure completely bypasses the need for the conscious encountering of feared objects. We demonstrate that our method can lead to reliable reductions in physiological fear responses measured by skin conductance as well as amygdala hemodynamic activity. Not only do these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring fear can be ""re-programmed"" outside of conscious awareness, importantly they also created the rare opportunity for a psychological intervention of this nature to be tested rigorously in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion.

Untangling cortico-striatal connectivity and cross-frequency coupling in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia,"Jovana Belic, Per Halje, Ulrike Richter, Per Petersson, Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski",Now published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience. 2015,"We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in the primary motor cortex and sensorimotor striatum in awake, freely behaving, 6-OHDA lesioned hemi-parkinsonian rats in order to study the features directly related to pathological states such as parkinsonian state and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. We analysed the spectral characteristics of the obtained signals and observed that during dyskinesia the most prominent feature was a relative power increase in the high gamma frequency range at around 80 Hz, while for the parkinsonian state it was in the beta frequency range. Here we show that during both pathological states effective connectivity in terms of Granger causality is bidirectional with an accent on the striatal influence on the cortex. In the case of dyskinesia, we also found a high increase in effective connectivity at 80 Hz. In order to further understand the 80- Hz phenomenon, we performed cross-frequency analysis and observed characteristic patterns in the case of dyskinesia but not in the case of the parkinsonian state or the control state. We noted a large decrease in the modulation of the amplitude at 80 Hz by the phase of low frequency oscillations (up to ~10 Hz) across both structures in the case of dyskinesia. This may suggest a lack of coupling between the low frequency activity of the recorded network and the group of neurons active at ~80 Hz.",['belic@kth.se'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/23/028027,biorxiv,2015,55efebf9-cd91-4b96-a7d0-544182da4666,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/23/028027.full.pdf

We leveraged this computational goal to study the fine-scale temporal dynamics of neural populations in posterior and anterior inferior temporal cortex (pIT, aIT) during face detection. As expected, we found that a neural spiking preference for natural over distorted face images was rapidly produced, first in pIT and then in aIT. Strikingly, in the next 30 milliseconds of processing, this pattern of selectivity in pIT completely reversed, while selectivity in aIT remained unchanged. Although these dynamics were difficult to explain from a pure feedforward perspective, a model class computing errors through feedback closely matched the observed neural dynamics and parsimoniously explained a range of seemingly disparate IT neural response phenomena.

We found that neural ensembles in prefrontal cortex selectively recalled the same pattern of activity after reinforcement for a correct decision. This reinforcement-selective recall only reliably occurred immediately before the abrupt behavioural transitions indicating successful learning of the current rule, and faded quickly thereafter.

Here we consider the alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not.

S/HIC: Robust identification of soft and hard sweeps using machine learning,"Daniel R Schrider, Andrew D Kern",Now published in PLOS Genetics. 2016,"Detecting the targets of adaptive natural selection from whole genome sequencing data is a central problem for population genetics. However, to date most methods have shown sub-optimal performance under realistic demographic scenarios. Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/HIC, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/HIC has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover we show that S/HIC is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/HIC still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally we apply S/HIC to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods.",['dan.schrider@rutgers.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/04/024547,biorxiv,2016,8791e902-f7ea-4f90-8783-c108fc560dd8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/04/024547.full.pdf

This approach requires biologically relevant gene sets, which are currently curated manually, limiting their availability and accuracy in many organisms without extensively curated resources. New feature learning approaches can now be paired with existing data collections to directly extract functional gene sets from big data.  Results: Here we introduce a method to identify perturbed processes. In contrast with methods that use curated gene sets, this approach uses signatures extracted from public expression data. We first extract expression signatures from public data using ADAGE, a neural network-based feature extraction approach. We next identify signatures that are differentially active under a given treatment. Our results demonstrate that these signatures represent biological processes that are perturbed by the experiment. Because these signatures are directly learned from data without supervision, they can identify uncurated or novel biological processes. We implemented ADAGE signature analysis for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the convenience of different user groups, we implemented both an R package (ADAGEpath) and a web server (http://adage.greenelab.com) to run these analyses. Both are open-source to allow easy expansion to other organisms or signature generation methods. We applied ADAGE signature analysis to an example dataset in which wild-type and Δanr mutant cells were grown as biofilms on the Cystic Fibrosis genotype bronchial epithelial cells. We mapped active signatures in the dataset to KEGG pathways and compared with pathways identified using GSEA. The two approaches generally return consistent results; however, ADAGE signature analysis also identified a signature that revealed the molecularly supported link between the MexT regulon and Anr.  Conclusions: We designed ADAGE signature analysis to perform gene set analysis using data-defined functional gene signatures.

To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats (BatDetect). Our deep learning algorithms (CNNFULL and CNNFAST) were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Romania and Bulgaria by citizen scientists as part of the iBats programme and labelled by users of www.batdetective.org. We compared the performance of our system to other algorithms and commercial systems on expert verified test datasets recorded from different sensors and countries. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on iBats monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Here, we show that both CNNFULL and CNNFAST deep learning algorithms have a higher detection performance (average precision, and recall) of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets, when compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems tested. Precision scores for commercial systems were reasonably good across all test datasets (>0.7), but this was at the expense of recall rates. In particular, our deep learning approaches were better at detecting calls in road-transect data, which contained more noisy recordings. Our comparison of CNNFULL and CNNFAST algorithms was favourable, although CNNFAST had a slightly poorer performance, displaying a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our example monitoring application demonstrated that our open-source, fully automatic, BatDetect CNNFAST pipeline does as well or better compared to a commercial system with manual verification previously used to analyse monitoring data. We show that it is possible to both accurately and automatically detect bat search-phase echolocation calls, particularly from noisy audio recordings. Our detection pipeline enables the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale, particularly when combined with automatic species identification.

Yet, owing to extensive genetic heterogeneity, multiple modes of inheritance and limited study sizes, sequencing and quantitative genetics approaches have had limited success in characterizing the complex genetics of ASD. Currently, only a small fraction of potentially causal genes -about 65 genes out of an estimated several hundred- are known based on strong genetic evidence. Hence, there is a critical need for complementary approaches to further characterize the genetic basis of ASD, enabling development of better screening and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific functional gene interaction network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism-associated genes, including hundreds of candidate genes for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach is validated in an independent case-control sequencing study of approximately 2,500 families. Leveraging these genome-wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrate that the large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key cellular pathways and specific developmental stages of the brain. Specifically, integration with spatiotemporal transcriptome expression data implicates early fetal and midfetal stages of the developing human brain in ASD etiology. Likewise, analysis of the connectivity of top autism genes in the brain-specific interaction network reveals the breadth of autism-associated functional modules, processes, and pathways in the brain. Finally, we identify likely pathogenic genes within the most frequent autism-associated copy-number-variants (CNVs) and propose genes and pathways that are likely mediators of autism across multiple CNVs.

Overall, the viewers were largely consistent in their gaze behaviour, especially if the scene contained any persons. We took a fresh approach to relate the eye-gaze data to the MEG signals by characterizing dynamic cortical representations by means of representational distance matrices. Specifically, we compared the representational distances between the stimuli in the evoked MEG responses with predictions based (1) on the low-level visual similarity of the stimuli (as visually more similar stimuli evoke more similar responses in early visual areas) and (2) on the eye-gaze data. At 50-75 ms after the scene onset, the similarity of the occipital MEG patterns correlated with the low-level visual similarity of the scenes, and already at 75-100 ms the visual features attracting the first saccades predicted the similarity of the right parieto-occipital MEG responses. Thereafter, at 100-125 ms, the landing positions of the upcoming saccades explained MEG responses.

A machine learning classifier trained on cancer transcriptomes detects NF1 inactivation signal in glioblastoma," View ORCID ProfileGregory P Way,  View ORCID ProfileRobert J Allaway,  View ORCID ProfileStephanie J Bouley, Camilo E Fadul, Yolanda Sanchez,  View ORCID ProfileCasey S Greene",Now published in BMC Genomics. 2016,"Background
We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules.

Results
We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.","['yolanda.sanchez@dartmouth.edu', 'csgreene@upenn.edu', 'gregway@mail.med.upenn.edu', 'Robert.J.Allaway.GR@dartmouth.edu', 'Stephanie.J.Bouley.GR@dartmouth.edu', 'CEF3W@hscmail.mcc.virginia.edu', 'Yolanda.Sanchez@dartmouth.edu', 'csgreene@mail.med.upenn.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/13/075382,biorxiv,2016,3567dc2a-bba3-4091-bc24-e9bd1f1345e6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/13/075382.full.pdf

Here, we use genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) to generate a high- resolution map of spatial interactions of chromatin from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We show that from the earliest stages of development the genome is divided into distinct topologically associated domains (TADs), that we can map the boundaries between TADs to sub- kilobase resolution, and that these boundaries correspond to 500-2000 bp insulator elements. Comparing this map with a detailed assessment of the banding pattern of a region of a polytene chromosome, we show that these insulator elements correspond to low density polytene interbands that divide compacted bands, which correspond to TADs. It has been previously shown that polytene interbands have low packing ratios allowing the conversion of small genomic distances (in base pairs) into a large physical distances. We therefore suggest a simple mechanism for insulator function whereby insulators increase the physical space between adjacent domains via the unpacking and extension of intervening chromatin.

mLDM: a new hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for sparse microbioal association discovery,"Yuqing Yang, Ning Chen, Ting Chen",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Interpretive analysis of metagenomic data depends on an understanding of the underlying associations among microbes from metagenomic samples.Although several statistical tools have been developed for metagenomic association studies, they suffer from compositional bias or fail to take into account environmental factors that directly affect the composition of a given microbial community. In this paper, we propose metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints to bypass compositional bias and discover new associations among microbes and between microbes and environmental factors. The mLDM model can 1) infer both conditionally dependent associations among microbes and direct associations between microbes and environmental factors; 2) consider both compositional bias and variance of metagenomic data; and 3) estimate absolute abundance for microbes. Thus, conditionally dependent association can capture direct relationship underlying microbial pairs and remove the indirect connections induced from other common factors. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of the mLDM model, using both synthetic data and the TARA Oceans eukaryotic data by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, mLDM is applied to western English Channel data and finds some interesting associations.","['tingchen@tsinghua.edu.cn', 'ningchen@tsinghua.edu.cn', 'G@Top', 'MG@Top', 'MG@Top', 'MG@Top', 'MG@Top', 'MG@Top', 'MG@Top']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/07/042630,biorxiv,2016,3cb1bc16-f9ec-419f-bc76-2df2dea94711,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/07/042630.full.pdf

One such strategy is to constrain retrieval towards relevant information by re-implementing the neurocognitive processes that were engaged during encoding. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics with which constraining retrieval towards semantic versus non-semantic information affects the processing of new “foil” information encountered during a memory test. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data acquired during an initial study phase revealed that semantic compared to non-semantic processing was associated with alpha decreases in a left frontal electrode cluster from around 600ms after stimulus onset. Successful encoding of semantic versus non-semantic foils during a subsequent memory test was related to decreases in alpha oscillatory activity in the same left frontal electrode cluster, which emerged relatively late in the trial at around 1000-1600ms after stimulus onset. Across subjects, left frontal alpha power elicited by semantic processing during the study phase correlated significantly with left frontal alpha power associated with semantic foil encoding during the memory test. Furthermore, larger left frontal alpha power decreases elicited by semantic foil encoding during the memory test predicted better subsequent semantic foil recognition in an additional surprise foil memory test. These findings indicate that constraining retrieval towards semantic information involves re-implementing semantic encoding operations that are mediated by alpha oscillations, and that such re-implementation occurs at a late stage of memory retrieval perhaps reflecting additional monitoring processes.",['jss30@cam.ac.uk.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/24/141648,biorxiv,2017,8c326e62-2846-4f13-9e54-4d6fc3f87902,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/24/141648.full.pdf

We show that explanted MZs generate tensile convergence forces up to 1.5 mN during gastrulation and over 4 mN thereafter. These forces are generated by convergent thickening (CT) until the midgastrula and increasingly by convergent extension (CE) thereafter. Explants from ventralized embryos, which lack tissues expressing CE but close their blastopores, produce up to 2 mN of tensile force, showing that CT alone generates forces sufficient to close the blastopore. Uniaxial tensile stress relaxation assays show stiffening of mesodermal and ectodermal tissues around the onset of neurulation, potentially enhancing long-range transmission of convergence forces.

Long-term adaptive evolution of genomically recoded Escherichia coli,"Timothy M. Wannier, Aditya Mohan Kunjapur, Daniel Paul Rice, Michael J. McDonald, Michael M. Desai, George M. Church",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Efforts are underway to construct several recoded genomes anticipated to exhibit multi-virus resistance, enhanced non-standard amino acid (NSAA) incorporation, and capability for synthetic biocontainment. Though we succeeded in pioneering the first genomically recoded organism (Escherichia coli strain C321.ΔA), its fitness is far lower than that of its non-recoded ancestor, particularly in defined media. This fitness deficit severely limits its utility for NSAA-linked applications requiring defined media such as live cell imaging, metabolic engineering, and industrial-scale protein production. Here, we report adaptive evolution of C321.ΔA for more than 1,000 generations in independent replicate populations grown in glucose minimal media. Evolved recoded populations significantly exceed the growth rates of both the ancestral C321.ΔA and non-recoded strains, permitting use of the recoded chassis in several new contexts. We use next-generation sequencing to identify genes mutated in multiple independent populations, and we reconstruct individual alleles in ancestral strains via multiplex automatable genome engineering (MAGE) to quantify their effects on fitness. Several selective mutations occur only in recoded evolved populations, some of which are associated with altering the translation apparatus in response to recoding, whereas others are not apparently associated with recoding, but instead correct for off-target mutations that occurred during initial genome engineering. This report demonstrates that laboratory evolution can be applied after engineering of recoded genomes to streamline fitness recovery compared to application of additional targeted engineering strategies that may introduce further unintended mutations.

To date synthetic biological feedback circuits have predominantly relied upon transcription factors and suffer from limitations such as excessive burden and lack of flexible tunability. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules which can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through interaction with messenger RNA (mRNA). In this paper, we design, model and build two new negative feedback architectures that use rationally-designed, translation-inhibiting sRNA modules for the first time. The first circuit builds upon the well characterised tet-based autorepressor, allowing fine tuning of the circuit output through the use of an external input molecule that modulates sRNA expression. The second circuit involves an sRNA in direct negative feedback with the output protein of the circuit, regulating the mRNA encoding this protein in response to output protein concentration. Stochastic and deterministic modelling, taking implementation topology into account, guided the design and the experimental data obtained compared well with model predictions.

Transdermal electrical neuromodulation of the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex improves sleep quality and mood.,"Alyssa M. Boasso, Hailey Mortimore, Rhonda Silva, Linh Aven,  View ORCID ProfileWilliam J. Tyler",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Achieving optimal human performance that involves cognitive or physical work requires quality sleep and a positive mental attitude. The ascending reticular activating system (RAS) represents a powerful set of endogenous neuromodulatory circuits that gate and tune global brain responses to internal and external cues, thereby regulating consciousness, alertness, and attention. The activity of two major RAS nuclei, the locus coeruleus (LC) and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), can be altered by trigeminal nerve modulation. Monosynaptic afferent inputs from the sensory components of trigeminal nerve branches project to the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TSNC), which has direct and polysynaptic connections to the LC and PPN. We previously found high-frequency (7 - 11 kHz) transdermal electrical neuromodulation (TEN) of the trigeminal nerve rapidly induces physiological relaxation, dampens sympathetic nervous system responses to acute stress, and suppresses levels of noradrenergic biomarkers. Given the established roles of LC and PPN neuronal activity in sleep regulation, psychophysiological arousal, and stress, we conducted three studies designed to test hypotheses that modulation of the TSNC can improve sleep quality and mood in healthy individuals (n = 99). Across a total of 1,386 days monitored, we observed TEN modulation of trigeminal and cervical nerves prior to sleep onset produced significant improvements in sleep quality and affective states, quantified using clinically validated surveys, overnight actigraph and heart rate recordings, and biochemical analyses compared to baseline or sham controls. Moreover, we observed some frequency dependence in that TEN delivered at lower frequencies (TENLF; 0.50 - 0.75 kHz) was significantly more effective at improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety than higher frequency TEN waveforms. Collectively our results indicate that transdermal electrical neuromodulation of trigeminal and cervical nerve branches can influence TSNC activity in a manner that significantly improves sleep quality and significantly reduces stress. We conclude that biasing RAS network activity to optimize sleep efficiency and enhance mood by electrically modulating TSNC activity through its afferent inputs holds tremendous potential for optimizing mental health and human performance.",['wjtyler@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/15/043901,biorxiv,2016,acea0ded-9df9-4b33-86e9-dabce1f99e5c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/15/043901.full.pdf

Thus, there is a need for a targeted sequencing assay that performs well with DNA of low quality and quantity without relying on extensive PCR amplification. We evaluated the performance of a targeted sequencing assay based on Oligonucleotide Selective Sequencing. This assay enables on to sequence and call variants from low amounts of damaged DNA. This assay utilizes a repair process developed to sequence clinical FFPE samples, followed by adaptor ligation to single stranded DNA and a primer-based capture technique. This approach generates sequence libraries of high fidelity without relying heavily on PCR amplification, and facilitates the assessment of copy number alterations across the target regions. Using an assay designed to capture the exons of a panel of 130 actionable cancer genes, we obtain an on-target rate of >50% and high uniformity across targeted regions at starting input DNA amounts of 10ng per sample.

Sparse Tensor Decomposition For Haplotype Assembly Of Diploids And Polyploids,"Abolfazl Hashemi, Banghua Zhu, Haris Vikalo",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"A framework that formulates haplotype assembly as sparse tensor decomposition is proposed. The problem is cast as that of decomposing a tensor having special structural constraints and missing a large fraction of its entries into a product of two factors, U and V; tensor V reveals haplotype information while U is a sparse matrix encoding the origin of erroneous sequencing reads. An algorithm, AltHap, which reconstructs haplotypes of either diploid or polyploid organisms by solving this decomposition problem is proposed. Starting from a judiciously selected initial point, AltHap alternates between two optimization tasks to recover U and V by relying on a modified gradient descent search that exploits salient structural properties of U and V. The performance and convergence properties of AltHap are theoretically analyzed and, in doing so, guarantees on the achievable minimum error correction scores and correct phasing rate are established. AltHap was tested in a number of different scenarios and was shown to compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods in applications to haplotype assembly of diploids, and significantly outperform existing techniques when applied to haplotype assembly of polyploids.","['abolfazl@utexas.edu', '13aeon.v01d@gmail.com', 'hvikalo@ece.utexas.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/26/130930,biorxiv,2017,b7ed882b-b687-4e20-bffa-1ec03d030a25,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/26/130930.full.pdf

Various genes that regulate sleep have been identified in invertebrates, but whether the functions of these genes are conserved in mammals remains poorly explored. Drosophila insomniac (inc) mutants exhibit severely shortened and fragmented sleep. Inc protein physically associates with the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase, and neuronal depletion of Inc or Cul3 strongly curtails sleep, suggesting that Inc is a Cul3 adaptor that directs the ubiquitination of neuronal substrates that regulate sleep. Three proteins similar to Inc exist in vertebrates - KCTD2, KCTD5, and KCTD17 - but are uncharacterized within the nervous system and their functional conservation with Inc has not been addressed. Here we show that Inc and its mouse orthologs exhibit striking biochemical and functional interchangeability within Cul3 complexes. Remarkably, KCTD2 and KCTD5 restore sleep to inc mutants, indicating that they can substitute for Inc in vivo and engage its neuronal targets that impact sleep. Inc and its orthologs traffic similarly within fly and mammalian neurons and are present at synapses, suggesting that their substrates include synaptic proteins. Consistent with such a mechanism, inc mutants exhibit defects in synaptic structure and physiology, indicating that Inc is vital for both synaptic function and sleep.

Integrative Deep Models for Alternative Splicing,"Anupama Jha, Matthew R Gazzara, Yoseph Barash",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2017,"Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction and show that it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over-expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.

We asked whether the approaches used to create eACRs can be transferred to other well-characterized cation-conducting channelrhodopsins (CCRs) to obtain eACRs with a broad spectrum of biophysical properties. We generated 22 variants using two conversion strategies applied to 11 CCRs and screened them for membrane expression, photocurrents and anion selectivity. We obtained two novel eACRs, Phobos and Aurora, with blue- and red-shifted action spectra and photocurrents similar to existing eACRs. Furthermore, step-function mutations greatly enhanced the cellular operational light sensitivity due to a slowed-down photocycle. These bistable eACRs can be reversibly toggled between open and closed states with brief light pulses of different wavelengths.

The mysterious orphans of Mycoplasmataceae,"Tatiana Tatarinova, Inna Lysnyansky, Yuri Nikolsky, Alexander Bolshoy",Now published in Biology Direct. 2015,"Background: The length of a protein sequence is largely determined by its function, i.e. each functional group is associated with an optimal size. However, comparative genomics revealed that proteins’ length may be affected by additional factors. In 2002 it was shown that in bacterium Escherichia coli and the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences with no homologs are, on average, shorter than those with homologs [1]. Most experts now agree that the length distributions are distinctly different between protein sequences with and without homologs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. In this study, we examine this postulate by a comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic genomes and focusing on certain exceptions. 
Results: We compared lengths’ distributions of ""having homologs proteins"" (HHPs) and ""non-having homologs proteins"" (orphans or ORFans) in all currently annotated completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As expected, the HHPs and ORFans have strikingly different length distributions in almost all genomes. As previously established, the HHPs, indeed, are, on average, longer than the ORFans, and the length distributions for the ORFans have a relatively narrow peak, in contrast to the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a wider range of values. However, about thirty genomes do not obey these rules. Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans distributions, with the mean lengths of ORFan larger than the mean lengths of HHPs. These genera constitute over 80% of atypical genomes.
Conclusions: We confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes the previous observation that HHPs and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We also showed that Mycoplasmataceae genomes have very distinctive distributions of ORFans lengths. We offer several possible biological explanations of this phenomenon.","['tatiana.tatarinova@usc.edu', 'innal@moag.gov.il', 'YNikolskiy@sk.ru', 'bolshoy@research.haifa.ac.il']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/28/025700,biorxiv,2015,f28fdd86-a33c-40ee-abc3-2d4f5c0bf2b9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/28/025700.full.pdf

LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples.

Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPK/ERK signaling for their induction.

In this pre-registered study, we investigated subjective conflict during intertemporal choice, whereby participants chose between smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards (e.g., $15 today vs. $22 in 30 days). We used economic modeling to parametrically vary eleven different levels of conflict, and recorded EEG data and pupil dilation. Midfrontal theta power, derived from EEG, correlated with pupil responses, and as predicted, these signals tracked even fine gradations of subjective conflict. Unexpectedly, both signals were also maximally enhanced when decisions were surprisingly easy. Therefore, these signals may track events requiring increased attention and adaptive shifts in behavioral responses, with conflict being only one type of such event.

Analyses by trauma type revealed a clear pattern of PTSD gene expression signatures distinguishing interpersonal (IP)-related traumas from combat-related traumas. Co-expression network analyses integrated all data and identified distinct gene expression perturbations across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD, including one wound-healing module down-regulated in men exposed to combat traumas, one IL12-mediated signaling module up-regulated in men exposed to IP-related traumas, and two modules associated with lipid metabolism and MAPK-activity up-regulated in women exposed to IP-related traumas. Remarkably, a high degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD was also observed converging on common signaling cascades, including cytokine, innate immune and type I interferon pathways. Collectively, these findings provide a broad view of immune dysregulation in PTSD and demonstrate inflammatory pathways of molecular convergence and specificity, which may inform mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.",['michael.breen@mssm.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/30/123182,biorxiv,2017,85260916-2586-4e90-8bda-22867625c5f7,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/30/123182.full.pdf
Instantaneous Brain Dynamics Mapped to a Continuous State Space,"Jacob Billings, Alessio Medda, Sadia Shakil, Xiaohong Shen, Amrit Kashyap, Shiyang Chen, Anzar Abbas, Xiaodi Zhang, Maysam Nezafati, Wen-Ju Pan, Gordon Berman, Shella Keilholz",Now published in NeuroImage. 2017,"Measures of whole-brain activity, from techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, provide a means to observe the brain's dynamical operations. However, interpretation of whole-brain dynamics has been stymied by the inherently high-dimensional structure of brain activity. The present research addresses this challenge through a series of scale transformations in the spectral, spatial, and relational domains. Instantaneous multispectral dynamics are first developed from input data via a wavelet filter bank. Voxel-level signals are then projected onto a representative set of spatially independent components. The correlation distance over the instantaneous wavelet-ICA state vectors is a graph that may be embedded onto a lower-dimensional space to assist the interpretation of state-space dynamics. Applying this procedure to a large sample of resting and task data (acquired through the Human Connectome Project), we segment the empirical state space into a continuum of stimulus-dependent brain states. We also demonstrate that resting brain activity includes brain states that are very similar to those adopted during some tasks, as well as brain states that are distinct from experimentally-defined tasks.

I investigated behavioral flexibility and problem solving abilities experimentally in great-tailed grackles, an invasive species and thus a likely candidate for possessing behavioral flexibility. I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies. It appears that behavioral flexibility can be an independent trait that varies across contexts.

DeepWAS: Directly integrating regulatory information into GWAS using deep learning supports master regulator MEF2C as risk factor for major depressive disorder," View ORCID ProfileGökcen Eraslan, Janine Arloth, Jade Martins, Stella Iurato, Darina Czamara, Elisabeth B. Binder, Fabian J. Theis, Nikola S. Mueller",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants predictive of common diseases but this does not directly inform on molecular mechanisms. The recently developed deep learning-based method DeepSEA uses DNA sequences to predict regulatory effects for up to 1000 functional units, namely regulatory elements and chromatin features in specific cell-types from the ENCODE project. 

Results: We here describe ""DeepWAS"", a conceptually new GWAS approach that integrates these predictions to identify SNP sets per functional units prior to association analysis based on multiple regression. To test the power of this approach, we use genotype data from a major depressive disorder (MDD) case/control sample (total N=1,537). DeepWAS identified 177 regulatory SNPs moderating 122 functional units. MDD regulatory SNPs were located mostly in promoters, intronic and distal intergenic regions and validated with public data.  Blood regulatory SNPs were experimentally annotated with methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs), expression quantitative trait methylation loci and expression QTLs and replicated in an independent cohort. Joint integrative analysis of regulatory SNPs and the independently identified annotations were connected through transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2C and ATF2, regulating a network of transcripts previously linked to other psychiatric disorders. In the latest GWAS for MDD, the MEF2C gene itself is within the top genome-wide significant locus. 

Conclusions: DeepWAS is a novel concept with the power to directly identify individual regulatory SNPs from genotypes. In a proof of concept study, MEF2C was identified as a master-regulator in major depression, a finding complementary to recent depression GWAS data, underlining the power of DeepWAS.",['nikola.mueller@helmholtz-muenchen.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/11/069096,biorxiv,2016,91c65ecb-3e1e-46cf-a8dd-82edcde5e12b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/11/069096.full.pdf

However, the physical rules that govern when such mRNA structures will inhibit translation remain unclear. Here, we introduced systematically designed RNA hairpins into the N-terminal coding region of a reporter protein with steadily increasing distances from the start codon, followed by characterization of their mRNA and expression levels in E. coli. We found that the mRNAs' translation rates were repressed, by up to 1410-fold, when mRNA structures overlapped with the ribosome's footprint. In contrast, when the mRNA structure was located outside the ribosome's footprint, translation was repressed by less than 2-fold. By combining our measurements with biophysical modeling, we determined that the ribosomal footprint extends 13 nucleotides into the N-terminal coding region and, when a mRNA structure overlaps or partially overlaps with the ribosomal footprint, the free energy to unfold only the overlapping structure controlled the extent of translation repression.

Prior work has indicated that structural brain connectivity constrains pairwise correlations in brain dynamics (also called functional connectivity), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured degree, betweenness, and clustering coeﬃcient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI dynamics at each brain region by computing 6930 time-series properties using the time-series analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag τ = 34s (partial Spearman correlation ρ = 0.58), as well as a range of related measures such as relative high frequency power (f > 0.4Hz: ρ = −0.43).

Unsupervised learning of DNA sequence features using a convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine," View ORCID ProfileWolfgang Kopp, Roman Schulte-Sasse",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Transcription factors (TFs) are important contributors to gene regulation. They specifically bind to short DNA stretches known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), which are contained in regulatory regions (e.g. promoters), and thereby influence a target gene's expression level. Computational biology has contributed substantially to understanding regulatory regions by developing numerous tools, including for discovering de novo motif. While those tools primarily focus on determining and studying TFBSs, the surrounding sequence context is often given less attention. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by adopting a so-called convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (cRBM) that captures redundant features from the DNA sequences. The model uses an unsupervised learning approach to derive a rich, yet interpretable, description of the entire sequence context. We evaluated the cRBM on a range of publicly available ChIP-seq peak regions and investigated its capability to summarize heterogeneous sets of regulatory sequences in comparison with MEME-Chip, a popular motif discovery tool.

Using large-scale recordings in the rat retina, we show that a homogeneous population of fast OFF ganglion cells simultaneously encodes two radically different features of a visual scene. Cells close to a moving object code linearly for its position, while distant cells remain largely invariant to the object's position and, instead, respond non-linearly to changes in the object's speed.

Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single FAB domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response.

Modern-Day SIV viral diversity generated by extensive recombination and cross-species transmission,"Sidney M Bell, Trevor Bedford",Now published in PLOS Pathogens. 2017,"Cross-species transmission (CST) has led to many devastating epidemics, but is still a poorly understood phenomenon.

While the immediate history of HIV is known, there are over 45 lentiviruses that infect specific species of primates, and patterns of host switching are not well characterized. We thus took a phylogenetic approach to better understand the natural history of SIV recombination and CST. We modeled host species as a discrete character trait on the viral phylogeny and inferred historical host switches and the pairwise transmission rates between each pair of 24 primate hosts. We identify 14 novel, well-supported, ancient cross-species transmission events. We also find that lentiviral lineages vary widely in their ability to infect new host species: SIVcol (from colobus monkeys) is evolutionarily isolated, while SIVagms (from African green monkeys) frequently move between host subspecies. We also examine the origins of SIVcpz (the predecessor of HIV-1) in greater detail than previous studies, and find that there are still large portions of the genome with unknown origins.

A dormant microbial component in the development of pre-eclampsia,"Douglas B Kell, Louise Clare Kenny",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a complex, multi-system disorder that remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Four main classes of dysregulation accompany PE, and are widely considered to contribute to its severity. These are abnormal trophoblast invasion of the placenta, anti-angiogenic responses, oxidative stress, and inflammation. What is lacking, however, is an explanation of how these themselves are caused.

We here develop the unifying idea, and the considerable evidence for it, that the originating cause of PE (and of the four classes of dysregulation) is in fact microbial infection, that most such microbes are dormant and hence resist detection by conventional (replication-dependent) microbiology, and that by occasional resuscitation and growth it is they that are responsible for all the observable sequelae, including the continuing, chronic inflammation. In particular, bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, are well known as highly inflammagenic and stimulate an innate (and possibly trained) immune response that exacerbates the inflammation further. The known need of microbes for free iron can explain the iron dysregulation that accompanies PE. We describe the main routes of infection (gut, oral, urinary tract infection) and the regularly observed presence of microbes in placental and other tissues in PE. Every known proteomic biomarker of “pre-eclampsia” that we assessed has in fact also been shown to be raised in response to infection.  An infectious component to PE fulfils the Bradford Hill criteria for ascribing a disease to an environmental cause, and suggests a number of treatments, some of which have in fact been shown to be successful.

PE was classically referred to as endotoxaemia or toxaemia of pregnancy, and it is ironic that it seems that LPS and other microbial endotoxins really are involved.

However, this technology has also raised several new computational challenges including questions related to handling the noisy and sometimes incomplete data, how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments and how to determine the state or function of specific cells based on their expression profile. To address these issues we develop and test a method based on neural networks (NN) for the analysis and retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data. We tested various NN architectures, some biologically motivated, and used these to obtain a reduced dimension representation of the single cell expression data. We show that the NN method improves upon prior methods in both, the ability to correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles.

In this study, we first use simulations to show that taxon sampling unequally affects nodes in a gene tree, which likely contributes to controversial conclusions from taxon sampling experiments and contradicting species phylogenies such as for the boreoeutherians. Hence, because it is unlikely that a large gene tree can be reconstructed correctly based on a single optimized dataset, we take a two-step approach for the construction of model gene trees. First, stable and unstable clades are identified by comparing phylogenetic trees inferred from multiple datasets and data types (nucleotide, amino acid, codon) from the same gene family. Subsequently, data subsets are optimized for the analysis of individual uncertain clades. Results are summarized in form of a model tree that illustrates the evolutionary relationship of gene loci. A case study shows how a seemingly complex gene phylogeny becomes increasingly consistent with the reference species tree by attentive taxon sampling and subtree analysis.

Quantifying uncertainty of taxonomic placement in DNA barcoding and metabarcoding,"Panu Somervuo, Douglas W. Yu, Charles Xu, Yinqiu Ji, Jenni Hultman, Helena Wirta, Otso Ovaskainen",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"1.	A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference databases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability.
2.	In this paper we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals, and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (from 800 to 130 000 species), and variation in the completeness of the reference databases (representing 15% to 100% of the species).
3.	Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased assessment of probabilities of taxonomic placement, and thus that its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence databases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels.
4.	Our results show that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging, and thus neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference.

A Varroa Destructor Protein Atlas Reveals Molecular Underpinnings Of Developmental Transitions And Sexual Differentiation,"Alison McAfee, Queenie W. T. Chan, Jay Evans, Leonard J. Foster",Now published in Molecular & Cellular Proteomics. 2017,"Varroa destructor is the most economically damaging honey bee pest, weakening colonies by simultaneously parasitizing bees and transmitting harmful viruses. Despite these impacts on honey bee health, surprisingly little is known about its fundamental molecular biology. Here we present a Varroa protein atlas crossing all major developmental stages (egg, protonymph, deutonymph and adult) for both male and female mites as a web-based interactive tool (http://foster.nce.ubc.ca/varroa/index.html). By intensity-based label-free quantitation, 1,433 proteins were differentially expressed across developmental stages, including two distinct viral polyproteins. Enzymes for processing carbohydrates and amino acids were among many of these differences as well as proteins involved in cuticle formation. Lipid transport involving vitellogenin was the most significantly enriched biological process in the foundress (reproductive female) and young mites. In addition, we found that 101 proteins were sexually regulated and functional enrichment analysis suggests that chromatin remodeling may be a key feature of sex determination. In a proteogenomic effort, we identified 519 protein-coding regions (169 of which were differentially expressed) supported by 1,464 peptides which were previously unannotated. Since this is a recurring trend with annotating genomes of non-model species, we analyzed their amino acid and nucleotide composition as well as their orthology to other species to suggest reasons why they may have been missed initially.

B Goodman",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Focused ultrasound (US) can stimulate specific regions of the brain non-invasively in animals and humans. This new brain stimulation method has the potential to provide a spatially precise treatment of neurological disorders and to advance brain mapping. To realize this potential, it is crucial to discover how US stimulates neurons. Toward this end, we devised a genetic dissection assay leveraging the well-characterized nervous system of C. elegans nematodes. We found that focused US (0.6--1.0 MPa, 10 MHz) elicits robust reversal behavior in wild-type animals. The response is preserved in animals deficient in thermosensation, yet absent in animals lacking neurons responsible for low-threshold touch sensation. We further found that the mechanical response rests on a properly functioning DEG/ENaC ion channel. Deletion of its MEC-4 subunit abolishes the response. The evidence for a mechanical nature of the response allowed us to maximize mechanical stimulation by pulsing the stimulus at specific pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs). The optimal range of PRFs aligned with that used for US neuromodulation in large mammals including humans, and is consistent with the prediction of a recent molecular model of mechanosensation. Thus, the mechanical forces associated with US are capable of activating mechanosensitive ion channels in a freely behaving animal. The mechanical nature of the effect proposes a specific pulsing protocol to activate neurons that possess mechanosensitive properties in the peripheral and central nervous systems of animals and humans.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/31/104463,biorxiv,2017,50ed979e-6848-4132-a74d-cc94247a5c9c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/31/104463.full.pdf

Robinson",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Ultra-flexible microelectrodes that can bend and flex with the natural movement of the brain reduce the inflammatory response and improve the stability of long-term neural recordings. However, current methods to implant these highly flexible electrodes rely on temporary stiffening agents that increase the electrode size thus aggravating neural damage during implantation, which leads to cell loss and glial activation that persists even after the stiffening agents are removed or dissolve. A method to deliver thin, ultra-flexible electrodes deep into neural tissue without increasing the stiffness or size of the electrodes will enable minimally invasive electrical recordings from within the brain. Here we show that specially designed microfluidic devices can apply a tension force to ultra-flexible electrodes that prevents buckling without increasing the thickness or stiffness of the electrode during implantation. Additionally, these fluidic microdrives allow us to precisely actuate the electrode position with micron-scale accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our 'fluidic microdrives', we used them to actuate highly flexible carbon nanotube fiber (CNTf) microelectrodes for electrophysiology. We used this approach in three proof-of-concept experiments. First, we recorded compound action potentials in a soft model organism, the small cnidarian Hydra. Second, we targeted electrodes precisely to the thalamic reticular nucleus in brain slices and recorded spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked extracellular action potentials. Finally, we inserted electrodes more than 4 mm deep into the brain of rats and detected spontaneous individual unit activity in both cortical and subcortical regions. Compared to syringe injection, fluidic microdrives do not penetrate the brain and prevent changes in intracranial pressure by diverting fluid away from the injection site during insertion and actuation.

Detection of statistically significant network changes in complex biological networks,"Raghvendra Mall, Luigi Cerulo, Halima Bensmail, Antonio Iavarone, Michele Ceccarelli",Now published in BMC Systems Biology. 2016,"Biological  networks  contribute  effectively  to unveil  the  complex structure  of  molecular interactions  and  to  discover driver  genes especially  in  cancer  context.   It  can happen  that  due  to  gene mutations, as for  example  when cancer progresses, the gene expression network undergoes some amount of localised re-wiring.  The ability to detect  statistical  relevant  changes  in  the  interaction  patterns induced by  the progression  of the disease  can lead to  discovery of novel relevant signatures.

Several procedures  have been recently proposed  to detect sub-network differences in pairwise labeled  weighted networks. In this paper, we propose  an  improvement  over   the  state-of-the-art  based  on  the Generalized  Hamming Distance  adopted  for evaluating the topological  difference  between   two  networks  and  estimating  its statistical  significance.   The proposed  procedure  exploits a  more effective   model  selection   criteria  to   generate   p-values  for statistical   significance  and   is  more   efficient  in   terms  of computational   time and prediction  accuracy than  literature methods.
Moreover, the structure of the  proposed algorithm allows for a faster parallelized implementation. In the case  of  dense  random geometric networks the proposed  approach is 10-15x faster and achieves 5-10% higher  AUC, Precision/Recall, and Kappa  value  than  the  state-of-the-art.

"Bemovi, software for extracting BEhaviour and MOrphology from VIdeos.","Frank Pennekamp, Nicolas Schtickzelle, Owen L. Petchey",Now published in Ecology and Evolution. 2014,"1. Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and vital to the services they provide. The essential role of microbes is due to high levels of functional diversity, which are, however, not always mirrored in morphological differentiation hampering their taxonomic identification. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders the measurement of morphological and behavioural traits at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals.
2. Recent advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital image analysis are promising approaches, however they miss out on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behaviour of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioural information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals.
3. We introduce bemovi, a package using R–the statistical computing environment–and the free image analysis software ImageJ. Bemovi is an automated digital video processing and analysis work flow to extract abundance and morphological and movement data for numerous individuals on a video, hence characterizing a population or community by multiple traits. Through a set of functions, bemovi identifies individuals present in a video and reconstruct their movement trajectories through space and time, merges measurements from all treated videos into a single database to which information on experimental conditions is added, readily available for further analysis in R.
4. We illustrate the validity, precision and accuracy of the method for experimental multi-species communities of protists in aquatic microcosms. We show the high correspondence between manual and automatic counts of individuals and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology and behaviour are constructed. We demonstrate how the data from videos can be used in combination with supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically classify individuals according to the species they belong to, and that information on movement behaviour can substantially improve the predictive ability and helps to distinguish morphologically similar species. In principle, bemovi should be able to extract from videos information about other types of organism, including microbes, so long as the individuals move relatively fast compared to their background.","['Frank.Pennekamp@ieu.uzh.ch', 'Nicolas.Schtickzelle@uclouvain.be', 'Owen.Petchey@ieu.uzh.ch']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/07/011072,biorxiv,2014,9510ae4a-716f-4d8c-b5da-326ae613055d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/07/011072.full.pdf
Proteus: A Random Forest Classifier to Predict Disorder-to-Order Transitioning Binding Regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.,"Sankar Basu, Fredrik Soderquist, Bjorn Wallner",Now published in Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design. 2017,"The focus of the computational structural biology community has taken a dramatic shift over the past one-and-a-half decades from the classical protein structure prediction problem to the possible understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) or proteins containing regions of disorder (IDPR). The current interest lies in the unraveling of a disorder-to-order transitioning code embedded in the amino acid sequences of IDPs / IDPRs. Disordered proteins are characterized by an enormous amount of structural plasticity which makes them promiscuous in binding to different partners, multi-functional in cellular activity and atypical in folding energy landscapes resembling partially folded molten globules. Also, their involvement in several deadly human diseases (e.g.  cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) makes them  attractive  drug targets, and  important for a biochemical understanding of the disease(s). The study of the structural ensemble of IDPs is rather difficult, in particular for transient interactions. When bound to a structured partner, an IDPR adapts an ordered conformation in the complex. The residues that undergo this disorder-to-order transition are called protean residues, generally found in short contiguous stretches and the first step in understanding the modus operandi of an IDP / IDPR would be to predict these residues. There are a few available methods which predict these protean segments from their amino acid sequences; however, their performance reported in the literature leaves clear room for improvement. With this background, the current study presents 'Proteus', a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of a residue undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a potential partner protein. The prediction is based on features that can be calculated using the amino acid sequence alone. Proteus compares favorably with existing methods predicting twice as many true positives as the second best method (55% vs. 27%) with a much higher precision on an independent data set. The current study also sheds some light on a possible 'disorder-to-order' transitioning consensus, untangled, yet embedded in the amino acid sequence of IDPs. Some guidelines have also been suggested for proceeding with a real-life structural modeling involving an IDPR using Proteus.",['w@ifm.liu.se'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/080788,biorxiv,2017,b6eff8c7-a74e-4fae-8c5d-d9931dca595e,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/080788.full.pdf
Inferring Weighted Gene Annotations from Expression Dat,"MIchael P Cary, Cynthia Kenyon",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Annotating genes with information describing their role in the cell is a fundamental goal in biology, and essential for interpreting data-rich assays such as microarray analysis and RNA-Seq.  Gene annotation takes many forms, from Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to tissues or cell types of significant expression, to putative regulatory factors and DNA sequences.  Almost invariably in gene databases, annotations are connected to genes by a Boolean relationship, e.g., a GO term either is or is not associated with a particular gene.  While useful for many purposes, Boolean-type annotations fail to capture the varying degrees by which some annotations describe their associated genes and give no indication of the relevance of annotations to cellular logistical activities such as gene expression.  We hypothesized that weighted annotations could prove useful for understanding gene function and for interpreting gene expression data, and developed a method to generate these from Boolean annotations and a large compendium of gene expression data.  The method uses an independent component analysis-based approach to find gene modules in the compendium, and then assigns gene-specific weights to annotations proportional to the degree to which they are shared among members of the module, with the reasoning that the more an annotation is shared by genes in a module, the more likely it is to be relevant to their function and, therefore, the higher it should be weighted.  In this paper, we show that analysis of expression data with module-weighted annotations appears to be more resistant to the confounding effect of gene-gene correlations than non-weighted annotation enrichment analysis, and show several examples in which module-weighted annotations provide biological insights not revealed by Boolean annotations.  We also show that application of the method to a simple form of genetic regulatory annotation, namely, the presence or absence of putative regulatory words (oligonucleotides) in gene promoters, leads to module-weighted words that closely match known regulatory sequences, and that these can be used to quickly determine key regulatory sequences in differential expression data.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/24/096677,biorxiv,2016,44b37082-5e62-48fc-9b39-413005fb5069,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/24/096677.full.pdf

Due to the combination of its strong geographic differentiation and association with malaria resistance, DARC is considered a canonical example of a locus under positive selection in humans.

Here, we use sequencing data from over 1,000 individuals in twenty-one human populations, as well as ancient human and great ape genomes, to analyze the fine scale population structure of DARC. We estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the FY*O mutation to be 42 kya (95% CI: 34-49 kya).

Learning Structural Motif Representations For Efficient Protein Structure Search,"Yang Liu, Qing Ye, Liwei Wang, Jian Peng",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Understanding the relationship between protein structure and function is a fundamental problem in protein science.  Given a protein of unknown function, fast identification of similar protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a critical step for inferring its biological function. Such structural neighbors can provide evolutionary insights into protein conformation, interfaces and binding sites that are not detectable from sequence similarity. However, the computational cost of performing pairwise structural alignment against all structures in PDB is prohibitively expensive. Alignment-free approaches have been introduced to enable fast but coarse comparisons by representing each protein as a vector of structure features or fingerprints and only computing similarity between vectors. As a notable example, FragBag represents each protein by a “bag of fragments”, which is a vector of frequencies of contiguous short backbone fragments from a predetermined library. Here we present a new approach to learning effective structural motif presentations using deep learning. We develop DeepFold, a deep convolutional neural network model to extract structural motif features of a protein structure. Similar to FragBag, DeepFold represents each protein structure or fold using a vector of learned structural motif features. We demonstrate that DeepFold substantially outperforms FragBag on protein structural search on a non-redundant protein structure database and a set of newly released structures. Remarkably, DeepFold not only extracts meaningful backbone segments but also finds important long-range interacting motifs for structural comparison.

Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current protocols to directly sequence the TCR require the use of long sequencing reads, increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed.

This suggests that TCR usage contributes to heterogeneity in the differentiation state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV.

Linking abnormalities across spatial scales remains difficult, partly because of technical limitations in measuring neuronal signatures concurrently at the scales involved. Here we use light sheet imaging of the larval zebrafish brain during acute epileptic seizure induced with pentylenetetrazole. Empirically measured spectral changes of spontaneous neuronal activity during the seizure are then modelled using neural mass models, allowing Bayesian inference on changes in effective network connectivity and their underlying synaptic dynamics. This dynamic causal modelling of seizures in the zebrafish brain reveals concurrent changes in synaptic coupling at macro- and mesoscale. Fluctuations of synaptic connection strength and their temporal dynamics are both required to explain observed seizure patterns. These findings challenge a simple excitation-inhibition account of seizures, and highlight changes in synaptic transmission dynamics as a possible seizure generation pathomechanism.","['r.rosch@ucl.ac.uk', 'r.rosch@ucl.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/07/160259,biorxiv,2017,5532ae09-d813-4d74-b83d-377fc856b13f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/07/160259.full.pdf

Speciation in Heliconius Butterflies: Minimal Contact Followed by Millions of Generations of Hybridisation,"Simon Henry Martin, Anders Eriksson, Krzysztof M. Kozak, Andrea Manica, Chris D.

Theoretical work has emphasized the potential for speciation in the face of ongoing hybridisation, and the genetic mechanisms that might facilitate this process. However, elucidating how the rate of gene flow between species may have changed over time has proved difficult. Here we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit a model of speciation between the Neotropical butterflies Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno. These species are ecologically divergent, rarely hybridize and display female hybrid sterility. Nevertheless, previous genomic studies suggests pervasive gene flow between them, extending deep into their past, and potentially throughout the speciation process. By modelling the rates of gene flow during early and later stages of speciation, we find that these species have been hybridising for hundreds of thousands of years, but have not done so continuously since their initial divergence. Instead, it appears that gene flow was rare or absent for as long as a million years in the early stages of speciation. Therefore, by dissecting the timing of gene flow between these species, we are able to reject a scenario of purely sympatric speciation in the face of continuous gene flow. We suggest that the period of minimal contact early in speciation may have allowed for the accumulation of genomic changes that later enabled these species to remain distinct despite a dramatic increase in the rate of hybridisation.",['shm45@cam.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/01/015800.1,biorxiv,2015,a5d9f896-876c-467d-8a1e-9b46ff500ed3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/01/015800.1.full.pdf

TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength.

Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRI's successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity.

Traumatic brain injury causes retention of long introns in metabolic genes via regulation of intronic Histone 3 lysine 36 methylation levels in the sub-acute phase of injury,"Arko Sen, Wen Wu, Oluwademi Okikiolu Nuga, Jenny Liu, Rayanne Burl, Katherine Gurdziel, Roger Pique-Regi, Maik Hüttemann, Douglas M Ruden",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause persistent pathological alteration of neurons. This may lead to cognitive dysfunctions, depression, and even increased susceptibility to life threatening diseases, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s Disease. To investigate the underlying genetic and molecular basis of TBI, Wasserman and colleagues developed an inexpensive and reproducible model for simulating TBI in Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit Fly). Using a modified version of this high impact trauma (HIT) device, we subjected w1118 fruit flies to mild closed head trauma. To determine the transcriptomic changes that contribute to survival post TBI, we collected fly heads from the survivors at 2 time points; 4 hours and 24 hours’ post-trauma. Mild TBI had limited impact on the steady state RNA levels but showed large perturbations in alternative splicing (AS) 24 hours’ post-trauma. Classification of these AS changes showed selective retention (RI) of long introns (>81bps), with a mean size of ~3000bps. Some of these RI genes also showed a significant reduction in transcript abundance and were specifically enriched in genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. The RI are enriched in ACACACA motifs known to bind to Smooth (SM), an hnRNPL class of splicing factor. Mutating SM (sm4/Df) resulted in reversal of RI observed 24 hours’ post-trauma, and in some cases, elimination of basal levels of RI in long introns. This observation suggests that SM is critical regulator of RI and that this process is enhanced by TBI. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) revealed increased levels of this histone modification in retained introns post-trauma. Consistent with this observation, mutations in lysine specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A), which de-methylate H3K36me3, increased RI in many of the same long introns affected by TBI. Additionally, higher H3K36me3 levels are observed around intronic SM-binding motifs post-trauma, suggesting interaction between H3K36me3 and SM binding to intronic splicing suppressor sites might be responsible for increasing RI of metabolic genes as a novel mechanism to improve survival after TBI.",['douglasr@wayne.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/25/077214,biorxiv,2016,81a5120c-fa25-4998-bc82-08df530a0d58,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/25/077214.full.pdf

However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited, and in particular identification of the RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been a difficult problem. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel semi-automatic algorithm, SARNAclust, to computationally identify combined structure/sequence motifs from immunoprecipitation data. SARNAclust is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised method that can identify RNA motifs at full structural resolution while also being able to simultaneously deconvolve multiple motifs. SARNAclust makes use of a graph kernel to evaluate similarity between sequence/structure objects, and provides the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through a bulge graph formalism. SARNAclust also includes a key method for predicting RNA secondary structure at CLIP peaks, RNApeakFold, that we have verified to be effective on synthetic motif data. We applied SARNAclust to 30 ENCODE eCLIP datasets, identifying known motifs and novel predictions. Notably, we predicted a new motif for the protein ILF3 similar to that for the splicing factor hnRNPC, providing evidence for interaction between these proteins.

Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this score to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence. We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively selected or neutral across various categories, including different types of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms is bimodal, with a neutral peak and a second peak at s ≈ −10^(−4). Other types of polymorphisms have shapes that fall roughly in between these two. We find that transcriptional start sites, strong CTCF-enriched elements and enhancers are the regulatory categories with the largest proportion of deleterious polymorphisms.",['fernandoracimo@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/06/19/002345,biorxiv,2014,0e04a942-a7f6-4b7d-ad99-ed7533f21e39,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/06/19/002345.full.pdf

However, neither the mechanisms by which genomic heterogeneity emerges within a single population nor how it drives the partitioning of ecological niches are well understood. Here we took advantage of billions of metagenomic reads to study one of the most abundant and widespread microbial populations in the surface ocean. We characterized its substantial amount of genomic heterogeneity using single-amino acid variants (SAAVs), and identified systematic purifying selection and adaptive mechanisms governing non-synonymous variation within this population. Our Deep Learning analysis of SAAVs across metagenomes revealed two main ecological niches that reflect large-scale oceanic current temperatures, as well as six proteotypes demarcating finer-resolved niches. We identified significantly more protein variants in cold currents and an increased number of protein sweeps in warm currents, exposing a global pattern of alternating genomic diversity for this SAR11 population as it drifts along with surface ocean currents.

As of yet, it has remained unclear whether public clones possess predictable sequence features that separate them from private clones, which are believed to be generated largely stochastically. This knowledge gap represents a lack of insight into the shaping of immune repertoire diversity. Leveraging a machine learning approach capable of capturing the high-dimensional compositional information of each clonal sequence (defined by the complementarity determining region 3, CDR3), we detected predictive public- and private-clone-specific immunogenomic differences concentrated in the CDR3's N1-D-N2 region, which allowed the prediction of public and private status with 80% accuracy in both humans and mice. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that not only public but also private clones possess predictable high-dimensional immunogenomic features. Our support vector machine model could be trained effectively on large published datasets (3 million clonal sequences) and was sufficiently robust for public clone prediction across studies prepared with different library preparation and high-throughput sequencing protocols. In summary, we have uncovered the existence of high-dimensional immunogenomic rules that shape immune repertoire diversity in a predictable fashion.

Because the PhILR transform relies on bacterial phylogenies, statistics applied in the PhILR coordinate system are also framed within an evolutionary perspective. Regression on PhILR transformed human microbiota data identified evolutionarily neighboring bacterial clades that may have differentiated to adapt to distinct body sites.

The cost of synonymous mutations is especially low in most of gag and pol, while much higher costs are observed in important RNA structures and regulatory regions.

Extracting a low-dimensional description of multiple gene expression datasets reveals a potential driver for tumor-associated stroma in ovarian cancer,"Safiye Celik, Benjamin A Logsdon, Stephanie Battle, Charles W Drescher, Mara Rendi, David Hawkins, Su-In Lee",Now published in Genome Medicine. 2016,"Background: Discovering patient subtypes and molecular drivers of a subtype are difficult and driving problems underlying most modern disease expression studies collected across patient populations. Expression patterns conserved across multiple expression datasets from independent disease studies are likely to represent important molecular events underlying the disease.

Methods: We present the INSPIRE (INferring Shared modules from multiPle gene expREssion datasets) method to infer highly coherent and robust modules of co-expressed genes and the dependencies among the modules from multiple expression datasets. Focusing on inferring modules and their dependencies conserved across multiple expression datasets is important for several reasons. First, using multiple datasets will increase the power to detect robust and relevant patterns (modules and dependencies among modules). Second, INSPIRE enables the use of multiple datasets that contain different sets of genes due to, e.g., the difference in microarray platforms. Many methods designed for expression data analysis cannot integrate multiple datasets with variable discrepancy to infer a single combined model, whereas INSPIRE can naturally model the dependencies among the modules even when a large proportion of genes are not observed on a certain platform.

Results: We evaluated INSPIRE on synthetically generated datasets with known underlying network structure among modules, and gene expression datasets from multiple ovarian cancer studies. We show that the model learned by INSPIRE can explain unseen data better and can reveal prior knowledge on gene functions more accurately than alternative methods. We demonstrate that applying INSPIRE to nine ovarian cancer datasets leads to the identification of a new marker and potential molecular driver of tumor-associated stroma - HOPX.  We also demonstrate that the HOPX module strongly overlaps with the genes defining the mesenchymal patient subtype identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer data.

A Genome Scan for Genes Underlying Adult Body Size Differences between Central African Pygmies and their Non-Pygmy Neighbors," View ORCID ProfileTrevor Pemberton,  View ORCID ProfilePaul Verdu, Noemie S. Becker,  View ORCID ProfileCristen J. Willer, Barry S. Hewlett, Sylvie Le Bomin, Alain Froment, Noah A. Rosenberg, Evelyne Heyer",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: Central African hunter-gatherer Pygmy populations have reduced body size compared with their often much larger agricultural non-Pygmy neighbors, potentially reflecting adaptation to the anatomical and physiological constraints of their lifestyle in tropical rainforests. Earlier studies investigating the genetics of the pygmy phenotype have focused on standing height, one aspect of this complex phenotype that is itself a composite of skeletal components with different growth patterns. Here, we extend the investigations of standing height to the variability and genetic architecture of sitting height and subischial leg length as well as body mass index (BMI) in a sample of 406 unrelated West Central African Pygmies and non-Pygmies.  Results: In addition to their significantly reduced standing height compared with non-Pygmies, we find Pygmies to have significantly shorter sitting heights and subischial leg lengths as well as higher sitting/standing height ratios than non-Pygmies. However, while male Pygmies had significantly lower BMI compared with male non-Pygmies, the BMI of females were instead similar. Consistent with prior observations with standing height, sitting height and subischial leg length were strongly correlated with inferred levels of non-Pygmy genetic admixture while BMI was instead weakly correlated, likely reflecting the greater contribution of non-genetic factors to the determination of body weight compared with height. Using 196,725 SNPs on the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip with genotypes on 358 Pygmy and 169 non-Pygmy individuals together with single- and multi-marker association approaches, we identified a single genomic region and seven genes associated with Pygmy/non-Pygmy categorization as well as 9, 10, 9, and 10 genes associated with standing and sitting height, sitting/standing height ratio, and subischial leg length, respectively. Many of the genes identified have putative functions consistent with a role in determining their associated trait as well as the complex Central African pygmy phenotype.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of modestly sized datasets of Pygmies and non-Pygmies to detect biologically meaningful associations with traits contributing to the Central African pygmy phenotype. Moreover, they provide new insights into the phenotypic and genetic bases of the complex pygmy phenotype and offer new opportunities to facilitate our understanding of its complex evolutionary origins.","['verdu@mnhn.fr', 'Trevor.Pemberton@umanitoba.ca', 'nbecker@bio.lmu.de', 'cristen@umich.edu', 'hewlett@vancouver.wsu.edu', 'noahr@stanford.edu', 'sylvie.le-bomin@mnhn.fr', 'froment@mnhn.fr', 'heyer@mnhn.fr']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187369,biorxiv,2017,b986ad65-0bd7-4715-a807-44e03d8b1a4b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187369.full.pdf
Automated Detection of Records in Biological Sequence Databases that are Inconsistent with the Literature," View ORCID ProfileMohamed Reda Bouadjenek,  View ORCID ProfileKarin Verspoor,  View ORCID ProfileJustin Zobel",Now published in Journal of Biomedical Informatics. 2017,"We investigate and analyse the data quality of nucleotide sequence databases with the objective of automatic detection of data anomalies and suspicious records. Specifically, we demonstrate that the published literature associated with each data record can be used to automatically evaluate its quality, by cross-checking the consistency of the key content of the database record with the referenced publications. Focusing on GenBank, we describe a set of quality indicators based on the relevance paradigm of information retrieval (IR). Then, we use these quality indicators to train an anomaly detection algorithm to classify records as ""confident"" or ""suspicious"".
Our experiments on the PubMed Central collection show assessing the coherence between the literature and database records, through our algorithms, is an effective mechanism for assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency.

Scott Pine, Jennifer McDaniel, Michele Mehaffey, Marc Salit",Now published in BMC Genomics. 2015,"Genome-scale ?-omics? measurements are challenging to benchmark due to the enormous variety of unique biological molecules involved.  Mixtures of previously-characterized samples can be used to benchmark repeatability and reproducibility using component proportions as truth for the measurement.  We describe and evaluate experiments characterizing the performance of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) measurements, and discuss cases where mixtures can serve as effective process controls.

We apply a linear model to total RNA mixture samples in RNA-seq experiments.  This model provides a context for performance benchmarking.  The parameters of the model fit to experimental results can be evaluated to assess bias and variability of the measurement of a mixture.  A linear model describes the behavior of mixture expression measures and provides a context for performance benchmarking.  Residuals from fitting the model to experimental data can be used as a metric for evaluating the effect that an individual step in an experimental process has on the linear response function and precision of the underlying measurement while identifying signals affected by interference from other sources.  Effective benchmarking requires well-defined mixtures, which for RNA-Seq requires knowledge of the messenger RNA (mRNA) content of the individual total RNA components. We demonstrate and evaluate an experimental method suitable for use in genome-scale process control and lay out a method utilizing spike-in controls to determine mRNA content of total RNA in samples. 

Genome-scale process controls can be derived from mixtures.  These controls relate prior knowledge of individual components to a complex mixture, allowing assessment of measurement performance.  The mRNA fraction accounts for differential enrichment of mRNA from varying total RNA samples.  Spike-in controls can be utilized to measure this relationship between mRNA content and input total RNA.

Hidden diversity and macroevolutionary mode of Caulimoviridae uncovered by euphyllophyte paleoviruses,"Zhen Gong, Guan-Zhu Han",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Few viruses have been documented in plants outside angiosperms. Endogenous viral elements (paleoviruses) provide molecular fossils for studying the deep history and macroevolution of viruses. Endogenous plant pararetroviruses (EPRVs) are widespread across angiosperms, but little is known about EPRVs in earlier branching plants. Here we use a large-scale phylogenomic approach to investigate the diversity and macroevolution of plant pararetroviruses (formally known as Caulimoviridae). We uncover an unprecedented and unappreciated diversity of EPRVs in the genomes of gymnosperms and ferns. The known angiosperm viruses only constitute a minor part of the Caulimoviridae diversity. By characterizing the distribution of EPRVs, we show that no major euphyllophyte lineages escape the activity of Caulimoviridae, raising the possibility that many exogenous Caulimoviridae remain to be discovered in euphyllophytes. We find that the copy numbers of EPRVs are generally high, suggesting that EPRVs define a unique group of repetitive elements and represent major components of euphyllophyte genomes. Phylogenetic analyses reveal an ancient monilophyte origin of Caulimoviridae and at least three independent origins of Caulimoviridae in angiosperms by cross-division transmissions.

Here, we employ models that explicitly account for load effects to   investigate how these impact the robustness of a stable gene transcription network to parameter perturbations. By employing a combination of sampling-based methods and analytical tools from control theory, we demonstrate that the presence of  loading  shrinks the region of parameter space where a gene circuit performs the desired function.

Activity Dynamics and Signal Representation in Striatal Network Model with Distance-dependent Connectivity,"Sebastian Spreizer, Martin Angelhuber, Jyotika Bahuguna, Ad Aertsen, Arvind Kumar",Now published in eneuro. 2016,"Striatum is predominantly inhibitory and the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia. A functional characterization of its activity dynamics is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying phenomenon such as action selection and initiation. Here, we investigated the effects of the spatial connectivity structure on the emergence and maintenance of localized bumps of activity in large-scale striatal networks (10,000 neurons). We show that in striatal network model in which the distance-dependent connection probability varies in a Gaussian fashion (Gaussian networks), the activity remains asynchronous irregular (AI) and spatially homogeneous, independent of the background input. By contrast, when the distance-dependent connectivity varies according to a Gamma distribution (Gamma networks), with short-range connectivity suppressed, a repertoire of activity dynamics can be observed: While weak background inputs induce spatially homogeneous AI activity, stronger background inputs induce stable, spatially localized activity bumps as in 'winner-take-all' (WTA) dynamics. Interestingly, for intermediate background inputs, the networks exhibit spatially localized, but unstable activity bumps (Transition Activity, TA), resembling the experimentally observed neuronal assembly dynamics in the striatum.
Among the three main regimes of network activity (AI, WTA, TA) we found that in the AI and TA regimes, network dynamics are flexible and can be easily modified by external stimuli. Moreover, the dynamical state of the network returns to the baseline after the stimulus is removed. By contrast, the dynamics in the WTA state are rigid and can only be changed by very strong external stimuli. These results support the hypothesis that the flexibility of the striatal network state in response to stimuli is important for its normal function and the 'rigid' network states (WTA) correspond to brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, where the striatum looses its repertoire of dynamic states and is only receptive to very strong inputs.","['sebastian.spreizer@bcf.uni-freiburg.de', 'arvkumar@kth.se']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/19/081752,biorxiv,2016,8bdc1f6d-d792-4a9a-8a2d-463316964203,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/19/081752.full.pdf
A scalable Bayesian method for integrating functional information in genome-wide association studies,"Jingjing Yang, Lars G.

Recent genomic sequencing studies have produced a rich resource of annotations that help characterize the function of genetic variants. Integrative analysis that incorporates these functional annotations into GWAS can help elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the identified associations and help prioritize causal-variants. Here, we develop a novel, flexible Bayesian variable selection model with efficient computational techniques for such integrative analysis. Different from previous approaches, our method models the effect-size distribution and probability of causality for variants with different annotations and jointly models genome-wide variants to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD), thus prioritizing associations based on the quantification of the annotations and allowing for multiple causal-variants per locus. Our efficient computational algorithm dramatically improves both computational speed and posterior sampling convergence by taking advantage of the block-wise LD structures of human genomes. With simulations, we show that our method accurately quantifies the functional enrichment and performs more powerful for identifying true causal-variants than several competing methods. The power gain brought up by our method is especially apparent in cases when multiple causal-variants in LD reside in the same locus. We also apply our method for an in-depth GWAS of age-related macular degeneration with 33,976 individuals and 9,857,286 variants. We find the strongest enrichment for causality among non-synonymous variants (54x more likely to be causal, 1.4x larger effect-sizes) and variants in active promoter (7.8x more likely, 1.4x larger effect-sizes), as well as identify 5 potentially novel loci in addition to the 32 known AMD risk loci.

The extended model, or the recurrent neural network (RNN), embodied a hierarchical and distributed model of process memory as an integral part of visual processing. Unlike the CNN, the RNN learned spatiotemporal features from videos to enable action recognition.

We have analysed diversity and signatures of selection in the neotropical Heliconius butterflies using resequenced genomes from 58 wild-caught individuals of H. melpomene, and another 21 resequenced genomes representing 11 related species. By comparing intra-specific diversity and inter-specific divergence, we estimate that 31% of amino acid substitutions between Heliconius species are adaptive. Diversity at putatively neutral sites is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with recombination rate, indicating widespread linked selection. This process also manifests in significantly reduced diversity on longer chromosomes, consistent with lower recombination rates. Genetic hitchhiking around beneficial non-synonymous mutations has also had a significant impact on genetic variation in this species, but evidence for strong selective sweeps was limited overall. We did however identify two regions where distinct haplotypes have swept in different populations, leading to increased population differentiation.

Effects of linked selective sweeps on demographic inference and model selection,"Daniel R Schrider, Alexander G Shanku, Andrew D Kern",Now published in Genetics. 2016,"The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of datasets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models--often severely. Moreover, we find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. We argue that the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences may often be acting in natural populations. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.",['dan.schrider@rutgers.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/047019,biorxiv,2016,8ea078b2-e1ee-42f0-b12d-818beb109c59,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/047019.full.pdf

Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feed-forward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75-200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream. We further validated the accuracy of our encoding model by decoding stimulus identity in a left-out validation set of viewed objects, achieving state-of-the-art decoding accuracy.",['kseeliger@posteo.jp'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/18/118091,biorxiv,2017,35798b15-52d3-425b-8699-ce040cc89084,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/18/118091.full.pdf
Fine-mapping cellular QTLs with RASQUAL and ATAC-seq,"Natsuhiko Kumasaka, Andrew Knights, Daniel Gaffney",Now published in Nature Genetics. 2015,"When cellular traits are measured using high-throughput DNA sequencing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) manifest at two levels: population level differences between individuals and allelic differences between cis-haplotypes within individuals. We present RASQUAL (Robust Allele Specific QUAntitation and quality controL), a novel statistical approach for association mapping that integrates genetic effects and robust modelling of biases in next generation sequencing (NGS) data within a single, probabilistic framework. RASQUAL substantially improves causal variant localisation and sensitivity of association detection over existing methods in RNA-seq, DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximise association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,706 independent caQTLs (FDR 10%) and illustrate how RASQUAL's improved causal variant localisation provides powerful information for fine-mapping disease-associated variants. We also map “multipeak” caQTLs, identical genetic associations found across multiple, independent open chromatin regions and illustrate how genetic signals in ATAC-seq data can be used to link distal regulatory elements with gene promoters. Our results highlight how joint modelling of population and allele-specific genetic signals can improve functional interpretation of noncoding variation.","['dg13@sanger.ac.uk', 'Power@FPR10', 'Power@FPR10']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/04/30/018788,biorxiv,2015,eb60ac78-f040-4554-9f98-8e4022c8e4c2,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/04/30/018788.full.pdf

Bacterial small RNAs and antisense RNAs (sRNAs) are often assumed to be noncoding, due to their lack of long open reading frames (ORFs). However, there are numerous examples of sRNAs encoding for small proteins, whether or not they also have a regulatory role at the RNA level. Here, we apply flexible machine learning techniques based on sequence features and comparative genomics to quantify the prevalence of sRNA ORFs under natural selection to maintain protein-coding function in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. A majority of annotated sRNAs have at least one ORF between 10 and 50 amino acids long, and we conservatively predict that 188 ± 25.5 unannotated sRNA ORFs are under selection to maintain coding, an average of 13 per species considered here. This implies that overall at least 7.5 ± 0.3% of sRNAs have a coding ORF, and in some species at least 20% do. 84 ± 9.8 of these novel coding ORFs have some antisense overlap to annotated ORFs. As experimental validation, many of our predictions are translated according to ribosome profiling data and are identified via mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics. B. subtilis sRNAs with coding ORFs are enriched for high expression in biofilms and confluent growth, and two S. pneumoniae sRNAs with coding ORFs are involved in virulence. sRNA coding ORFs are enriched for transmembrane domains and many are novel components of type I toxin/antitoxin systems.

In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate the uncertainty of DL in medical diagnostics based on a recent theoretical insight on the link between dropout networks and approximate Bayesian inference. Using the example of detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus photographs, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral improves diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets showed robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0%-20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection.

Targeted proteomics, most commonly implemented as selected reaction monitoring, has emerged as a powerful alternative and succeeded in providing a data independent approach for reproducible quantitative proteomics data but is limited in the number of proteins quantified. SWATH-MS is a recently introduced technique consisting of a data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) achieved in targeted proteomics but on the scale of thousands of proteins. While previous SWATH-MS studies have shown high intra-lab reproducibility, this has not been evaluated on an inter-lab basis. In this multi-laboratory evaluation study using data from 11 sites worldwide, we have demonstrated that using SWATH-MS we can consistently detect and quantify more than 4,000 proteins from HEK293 cells and that the quantitative protein data generated across laboratories is reproducible. Using synthetic peptide dilution series, we have shown that the sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility established with SWATH-MS methods are also uniformly achieved across labs.

Often, we know little about why so many genes are involved in complex common diseases. We hypothesized that this multigene effect arises from the relationship between genes and physiological dynamics. We tested this hypothesis for arrhythmias as physiological dynamics define this disease. We integrated graph theory analysis of genomic and protein-protein interaction networks with dynamical models of ion channel function to identify the physiological dynamics of genome wide variation for five different arrhythmias. Regulatory networks for the cardiac conduction system and arrhythmias were constructed from GWAS and known disease genes. Electrophysiological models of myocyte action potentials were used to conduct extensive parameter variations to identify robust and fragile kinetic parameters that were then, using regulatory networks, associated with genomic determinants.  We find that genome-wide determinants of arrhythmias that represent many cellular processes are selectively associated with fragile physiological dynamics of ion channel kinetics. This association predicts disease propensity. Deep RNA sequencing from human left ventricular tissue of arrhythmia and control subjects confirmed the predictive relationship.

A novel Word2vec based tool to estimate semantic similarity of genes by using Gene Ontology terms,"Dat Duong, Eleazar Eskin, Jessica Li",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes and proteins in the cell. A GO term contains one or two sentences describing a biological aspect. GO database is used in many applications. One application is the comparison of two genes or two proteins by first comparing semantic similarity of the GO terms that annotate them. Previous methods for this task have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this old paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce a new solution to the problem of comparing two GO terms. Our method uses natural language processing (NLP) and does not rely on the GO tree. In our approach, we use the Word2vec model to compare two words. Using this model as the key building-block, we compare two sentences, and definitions of two GO terms. Because a gene or protein is annotated by a set of GO terms, we can apply our method to compare two genes or two proteins. We validate our method in two ways. In the first experiment, we measure the similarity of genes in the same regulatory pathways. In the second experiment, we test the model's ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. Our results are equivalent to those of previous methods which depend on the GO tree.

Tracking dynamic threat imminence,"Christian T. Meyer, Srikanth Padmala, Luiz Pessoa",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"During many real-life situations, multiple factors interact to determine threat level. Importantly, their interaction evolves over time, such that aversive anticipation changes dynamically. Studies have taken initial strides at understanding how factors such as proximity and direction influence responses to threat. However, by and large, these studies have investigated the contributions of independent threat-related factors. Therefore, little is known about how they dynamically interact during aversive anticipation. To address these gaps, in the current functional MRI study involving healthy adult human volunteers, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction, and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm. Whereas some brain regions tracked individual threat-related factors, others were also sensitive to combinations of these variables, including their three-way combination. For example, the hippocampus was particularly sensitive to threat proximity. In contrast, among others, signals in the anterior insula and PAG tracked the interaction of all three factors. In the right amygdala, we observed a proximity by direction interaction, but in the opposite direction as the anterior insula and PAG; retreat vs. approach responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. Thus, in the context of our task, intriguingly, it appears that the amygdala provided a safety-related response, especially when threat was closer. Taken together, our study refines our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved during aversive anticipation in human brain.

Visual features as stepping stones toward semantics: Explaining object similarity in IT and perception with non-negative least squares.,"Kamila M Jozwik, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, Marieke Mur",Now published in Neuropsychologia. 2015,"Object similarity, in brain representations and conscious perception, must reflect a combination of the visual appearance of the objects on the one hand and the categories the objects belong to on the other. Indeed, visual object features and category membership have each been shown to contribute to the object representation in human inferior temporal (IT) cortex, as well as to object-similarity judgments. However, the explanatory power of features and categories has not been directly compared. Here, we investigate whether the IT object representation and similarity judgments are best explained by a categorical or a feature-based model. We use rich models (> 100 dimensions) generated by human observers for a set of 96 real-world object images. The categorical model consists of a hierarchically nested set of category labels (such as 'human', 'mammal', 'animal'). The feature model includes both object parts (such as 'eye', 'tail', 'handle') and other descriptive features (such as 'circular', 'green', 'stubbly'). We used non-negative least squares to fit the models to the brain representations (estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data) and to similarity judgments. Model performance was estimated on held-out images not used in fitting. Both models explained significant variance in IT and the amounts explained were not significantly different. The combined model did not explain significant additional IT variance, suggesting that it is the shared model variance (features correlated with categories, categories correlated with features) that best explains IT. The similarity judgments were almost fully explained by the categorical model, which explained significantly more variance than the feature-based model. The combined model did not explain significant additional variance in the similarity judgments. Our findings suggest that IT uses features that help to distinguish categories as stepping stones toward a semantic representation. Similarity judgments contain additional categorical variance that is not explained by visual features, reflecting a higher-level more purely semantic representation.

Computational methods are frequently employed to assist in the prediction of protein stability upon mutation. These methods utilize a combination of protein sequence data, protein structure data, empirical energy functions, and physicochemical properties of amino acids. In this work, we present the first use of dynamic protein structural features in order to improve stability predictions upon mutation. This is achieved through the use of a set of timeseries extracted from microsecond timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of proteins. Standard machine learning algorithms using mean, variance, and histograms of these timeseries were found to be 60-70% accurate in stability classification based on experimental ΔΔG or protein-chaperone interaction measurements. A recurrent neural network with full treatment of timeseries data was found to be 80% accurate according the F1 score. The performance of our models was found to be equal or better than two recently developed machine learning methods for binary classification as well as two industry-standard stability prediction algorithms.

The use of dynamic structural features allows for novel insight into the molecular basis of protein disruption by mutation in a diverse set of soluble proteins.

However, whilst 1 mg/ml dsRNA and 50 mM serotonin also triggers statistically significant flp-21 knockdown (-51%**) over a 48 h timecourse, it does not trigger the null sensory phenotypes; statistically significant target knockdown can still lead to false negative results, necessitating appropriate experimental design.

Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus associated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include distant relatives of known insect pathogens, but also novel groups of insect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs we show that the viruses represent active infections of Drosophila. We find that the RNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and we detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of small RNAs also allows us to identify putative viral sequences that lack detectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying >2000 individually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30% of D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry multiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont—which is known to be protective against virus infections in Drosophila—we were unable to detect any relationship between the presence of Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available RNA-seq datasets we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila laboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some of the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in laboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing viruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses are shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Our results provide an essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus interaction in Drosophila, and the newly reported viral sequences will help develop D. melanogaster further as a model for molecular and evolutionary virus research.",['darren.obbard@ed.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/18/021154,biorxiv,2015,4d5b1889-eec6-44e0-a210-e3d56445b9bb,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/18/021154.full.pdf

Cortical slow oscillations (SO, 0.5-1 Hz) and thalamo-cortical spindle activity (12-15 Hz) during sleep, and their temporal coordination, are considered critical for memory formation. We investigated the potential of slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS), applied during a daytime nap in a sleep state-dependent manner, to modulate these activity patterns and sleep-related memory consolidation in 16 patients with MCI. 
Stimulation significantly increased overall SO and spindle power, amplified spindle power during SO up-phases, and led to stronger synchronization between SO and spindle power fluctuations in electroencephalographic recordings. Moreover, visual declarative memory was improved by so-tDCS compared to sham stimulation, associated with stronger synchronization.

However, how these signals are integrated to coordinate tissue patterning is still poorly understood. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are critical signaling components involved in signal integration and are regulated by a core Ca2+ signaling toolkit. Ca2+ signaling encodes a significant fraction of information in cells through both amplitude and frequency-dependent regulation of transcription factors and key regulatory enzymes. A range of intercellular Ca2+ transients, including coordinated oscillations, recently have been reported in Drosophila wing discs. In an accompanying paper, we show that impaired Ca2+ signaling impacts the final size and shape of the wing. Here, we discover specific spatiotemporal signatures of Ca2+ transients during wing disc development. To do so, we developed a new neural-network-based approach for registration of oscillatory signals in organs that frequently move during imaging, and a pipeline for spatiotemporal analysis of intercellular Ca2+ oscillations. As a specific test case, we further demonstrated that the morphogen pathway, Hedgehog, controls frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations uniformly in the tissue and is required for spatial patterning of oscillation amplitudes. Thus, the time-averaged dynamics of spontaneous intercellular Ca2+ transients reflect the morphogenetic signaling state of the tissue during development. This suggests a general mechanism of physiological signaling that provides a memory of morphogenetic patterns.

Common variation influencing susceptibility to sporadic PD has been primarily identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, like many other common genetic diseases, the genes impacted by common PD-associated variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize DA neuron populations in the mouse brain at embryonic and early postnatal timepoints. These data allow for the unbiased identification of DA neuron subpopulations, including a novel postnatal neuroblast population and SN DA neurons. Comparison of SN DA neurons with other DA neurons populations in the brain reveals a unique transcriptional profile, novel marker genes, and specific gene regulatory networks. By integrating these cell population specific data with published GWAS, we develop a scoring system for prioritizing candidate genes in PD-associated loci. With this, we prioritize candidate genes in all 32 GWAS intervals implicated in sporadic PD risk, the first such systematically generated list. From this we confirm that the prioritized candidate gene CPLX1 disrupts the nigrostriatal pathway when knocked out in mice.

Several theories have been proposed to this end. “Efficient coding” posits that neural circuits maximise information encoded about their inputs. “Sparse coding” posits that individual neurons respond selectively to specific, rarely occurring, features. Finally, “predictive coding” posits that neurons preferentially encode stimuli that are useful for making predictions. Except in special cases, it is unclear how these theories relate to each other, or what is expected if different coding objectives are combined. To address this question, we developed a unified framework that encompasses these previous theories and extends to new regimes, such as sparse predictive coding. We explore cases when different coding objectives exert conflicting or synergistic effects on neural response properties. We show that predictive coding can lead neurons to either correlate or decorrelate their inputs, depending on presented stimuli, while (at low-noise) efficient coding always predicts decorrelation. We compare predictive versus sparse coding of natural movies, showing that the two theories predict qualitatively different neural responses to visual motion.

Denoising genome-wide histone ChIP-seq with convolutional neural networks,"Pang Wei Koh, Emma Pierson, Anshul Kundaje",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2017,"Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments are commonly used to obtain genome-wide profiles of histone modifications associated with different types of functional genomic elements. However, the quality of histone ChIP-seq data is affected by a myriad of experimental parameters such as the amount of input DNA, antibody specificity, ChIP enrichment, and sequencing depth. Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.  Results: We introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs.

Williams",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Fossil pollen assemblages are widely used to reconstruct past vegetation community composition at time scales ranging from centuries to millennia. These reconstructions often are based on the observed relationships between the proportions of plant taxa in the source vegetation and the proportions of the corresponding pollen types in pollen assemblages collected from surface sediments. Pollen-vegetation models rely upon parameters whose values typically are assumed to be stable through time, but this assumption is largely unevaluated, due in part to the rarity of comprehensive forest data, particularly for earlier time periods.

Here we present a new dataset of early settlement-era pollen records for the upper Midwest of North America and combine it with three other pollen and forest composition datasets to assess the stability of the relationship between relative pollen composition and relative abundances of tree genera for two time periods: immediately prior to Euro-American settlement, and the late 20th Century. Over this time interval, Euro-American settlement resulted in widespread forest clearance for agriculture and logging, producing major changes to forest composition and structure and the pollen assemblages produced by these forests. These major changes provide an opportunity to test the constancy of the relationship between pollen and forest vegetation during a period of large vegetation change. Pollen-vegetation relationships are modeled, using a Generalized Linear Model, for thirteen upper Midwestern tree genera.

We find that estimates of pollen source radius for the gridded mesoscale data are 25-85 kilometers, consistent with prior studies. Pollen-vegetation relationships are significantly altered for several genera: Fagus, Betula, Tsuga, Quercus, Pinus, and Picea (p < 0.05). The use of contemporary pollen-vegetation relationships to model settlement era community composition significantly under-predicts the presence of Fagus, Betula, Tsuga, Quercus and Picea at all tree densities. Pinus is over-predicted at low relative proportions (<25%), but under-predicted at greater abundances. The divergence of pollen-vegetation relationships appears to be greatest for late-successional taxa characterized by high shade tolerance and low fire tolerance, although the statistical power is low for this analysis. 
Hence, the ongoing rapid changes in land use and ecological communities associated with the Anthropocene affect not just our ability to make confident ecological forecasts for the future, but can also modify our inferences about the past. In the Anthropocene era, which is characterized by its rapidly changing vegetation and climates, paleoecology must move from its traditional   reliance on spatial calibration datasets assumed to represent a single ""present"". Instead, when possible, paleoecologists should develop calibration datasets of pollen and forest composition that are distributed across major vegetation changes in time and space. 

Multitemporal calibration datasets are increasingly possible given the growing length and availability of vegetation observational data and will enable paleoecologists to better understand the complex processes governing pollen-vegetation relationships and make better-informed reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics.",['ellen.kujawa@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/18/037051,biorxiv,2016,caf52a4e-ea5b-4b69-b77c-a0391e6bed47,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/18/037051.full.pdf

When exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest computes a representation R of that signal which is then observed through a noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish to infer the ""filter"" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori knowledge of the ""noise function"" mapping R to M. In practice such noise functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show that, in the large data limit, this need for a pre-characterized noise function can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual information I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations. Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the Data Processing Inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained. We term these directions ""diffeomorphic modes"" and present an equation that allows these modes to be derived systematically.

These disordered regions play important roles in HIV's life cycle, particularly, V3 loop-dependent cell entry, which determines how the virus uses two coreceptors on immune cells, the chemokine receptors CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4) or both (R5X4 virus). Most infecting HIV-1 variants utilise CCR5, while a switch to CXCR4-use occurs in the majority of infections. Why does this ‘rewiring’ event occur in HIV-1 infected patients? As changes in the charge of the V3 loop are associated with this receptor switch and it has been suggested that charged residues promote structure disorder, we hypothesise that the intrinsic disorder of the V3 loop plays a role in determining cell tropism. To test this we use three independent data sets of gp120 to analyse V3 loop disorder. We find that the V3 loop of X4 virus has significantly higher intrinsic disorder tendency than R5 and R5X4 virus, while R5X4 virus has the lowest. These results indicate that structural disorder plays an important role in determining HIV-1 cell tropism and CXCR4 binding. We speculate that changes in N-linked glycosylation associated with tropism change (from R5 to X4) are required to stabilise the V3 loop with increased disorder tendency during HIV-1 evolution. We discuss the potential evolutionary mechanisms leading to the fixation of disorder promoting mutations and the adaptive potential of protein structural disorder in viral host adaptation.","['jiangx@tcd.ie', 'david.robertson@manchester.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/24/130161,biorxiv,2017,82c6cbae-c29b-4308-b62f-44cdc729867c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/24/130161.full.pdf
Empirical validation of directed functional connectivity,"Ravi D Mill, Anto Bagic, Walter Schneider, Michael W Cole",Now published in NeuroImage. 2016,"Mapping directions of influence in the human brain connectome represents the next phase in understanding its functional architecture. However, a host of methodological uncertainties have impeded the application of directed connectivity methods, which have primarily been validated via 'ground truth' connectivity patterns embedded in simulated functional MRI (fMRI) and magneto-/electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) datasets. Such simulations rely on many generative assumptions, and we hence utilized a different strategy involving empirical data in which a ground truth directed connectivity pattern could be anticipated with confidence. Specifically, we exploited the established 'sensory reactivation' effect in episodic memory, in which retrieval of sensory information reactivates regions involved in perceiving that sensory modality. Subjects performed a paired associate task in separate fMRI and MEG sessions, in which a ground truth reversal in directed connectivity between auditory and visual sensory regions was instantiated across task conditions. This directed connectivity reversal was successfully recovered across different algorithms, including Granger causality and Bayes network (IMAGES) approaches, and across fMRI ('raw' and deconvolved) and source-modeled MEG. These results extend simulation studies of directed connectivity, and offer practical guidelines for the use of such methods in clarifying causal mechanisms of neural processing.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/070979,biorxiv,2016,e6deac50-0414-4f19-9edb-71cff233c4f5,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/070979.full.pdf
A Mixture Copula Bayesian Network Model for Multimodal Genomic Data,"Qingyang Zhang, Xuan Shi",Now published in Cancer Informatics. 2017,"Gaussian Bayesian networks have become a widely used framework to estimate directed associations between joint Gaussian variables, where the network structure encodes decomposition of multivariate normal density into local terms. However, the resulting estimates can be inaccurate when normality assumption is moderately or severely violated, making it unsuitable to deal with recent genomic data such as the Cancer Genome Atlas data. In the present paper, we propose a mixture copula
Bayesian network model which provides great flexibility in modeling non-Gaussian and multimodal data for causal inference. The parameters in mixture copula functions can be efficiently estimated by a routine
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A heuristic search algorithm based on Bayesian information criterion is developed to estimate the network structure, and prediction can be further improved by the best-scoring network out of multiple predictions from random initial values. Our method outperforms Gaussian Bayesian networks and regular copula Bayesian networks in terms of modeling flexibility and prediction accuracy, as demonstrated using a cell signaling dataset.

Cell-type selective deletion of RSK2 reveals insights into altered signaling in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome,"Hu Zhu,  View ORCID ProfileRyan T. Strachan, Daniel Urban, Martilias Farrell, Wesley K. Kroeze, Justin G. English, Reid H. J. Olsen, Bryan L. Roth",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked syndromic form of mental retardation characterized by various skeletal dysmorphisms, moderate to severe mental retardation, and in some cases, psychosis. CLS is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RPS6KA3) gene encoding a growth factor-regulated serine/threonine kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2). We previously identified RSK2 as a novel interacting protein that tonically inhibits 5-HT2A receptor signaling by phosphorylating Ser-314 within the third intracellular loop. To determine if RSK2 inhibits 5-HT2A receptor signaling in vivo and whether disruption of RSK2 could lead to schizophrenia-like behaviors - as is seen in some CLS patients - we genetically disrupted the function of RSK2 either globally or selectively in forebrain pyramidal neurons in mice. Both global and forebrain-selective RSK2 deletion augmented the locomotor responses to the psychotomimetic drugs phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine (AMPH). Significantly, forebrain-selective deletion of RSK2 augmented 5-HT2A receptor signaling as exemplified by enhanced 5-HT2A-mediated c-fos activation and head-twitch response without altering the levels or distribution of 5-HT2A receptor protein. Thus, RSK2 modulates 5HT2A receptor function in vivo, and disruption of RSK2 leads to augmented psychostimulant-induced responses reminiscent of those seen in many animal models of schizophrenia. These findings strengthen the association between 5-HT2A receptor dysfunction and psychosis, and provide a potential mechanism underlying the schizophrenia-like symptoms present in some CLS patients.",['bryan_roth@med.unc.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/26/156257,biorxiv,2017,c800888f-d50a-43a0-a842-9e41fc3b9a7c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/26/156257.full.pdf

Reconstructing cancer karyotypes from short read data: the half full and half empty glass,"Rami Eitan, Ron Shamir",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: During cancer progression genomes undergo point mutations as well as larger segmental changes. The latter include, among others, segmental deletions duplications, translocations and inversions. The result is a highly complex, patient-specific cancer karyotype. Using high-throughput technologies of deep sequencing and microarrays it is possible to interrogate a cancer genome  and produce chromosomal copy number profiles and a list of breakpoints (“jumps”) relative to the normal genome. This information is very detailed but local, and does not give the overall picture of the cancer genome. One of the basic challenges in cancer genome research is to use such information to infer the cancer karyotype. We present here an algorithmic approach, based on graph theory and integer linear programming, that receives segmental copy number and breakpoint data as input and produces a cancer karyotype that is most concordant with them. We used simulations to evaluate the utility of our approach, and applied it to real data.  Results: By using a simulation model, we were able to estimate the correctness and robustness of the algorithm in a spectrum of scenarios. Under our base scenario, designed according to observations in real data, the algorithm correctly inferred 69% of the karyotypes. However, when using less stringent correctness metrics that account for incomplete and noisy data, 87% of the reconstructed karyotypes were correct. Furthermore, in scenarios where the data were very clean and complete, accuracy rose to 90%-100%. Some examples of analysis of real data, and the karyotypes reconstructed by our algorithm, are also presented.  Conclusion: While reconstruction of complete, perfect karyotype based on short read data is very hard, a large portion of the reconstruction will still be correct and can provide useful information.","['rshamir@tau.ac.il', 'rami.eitan@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/20/152447,biorxiv,2017,e5218479-e8fb-44a7-8086-224dced490ff,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/20/152447.full.pdf
Multivariate pattern analysis for MEG: a comprehensive comparison of dissimilarity measures," View ORCID ProfileMatthias Guggenmos, Philipp Sterzer, Radoslaw M. Cichy",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods such as decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) are growing rapidly in popularity for the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, little is known about the relative performance and characteristics of the specific dissimilarity measures used to describe differences between evoked activation patterns. Here we used a multisession MEG dataset to qualitatively characterize a range of dissimilarity measures and to quantitatively compare them with respect to classification accuracy (for decoding) and between-session reliability of representational dissimilarity matrices (for RSA). We tested dissimilarity measures from a range of classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis - LDA, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Weighted Robust Distance - WeiRD, Gaussian Naive Bayes - GNB) and distances (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation). In addition, we evaluated three key processing choices: 1) preprocessing (noise normalisation, removal of the pattern mean), 2) weighting classification accuracies by decision values, and 3) computing distances in three different partitioning schemes (non-cross-validated, cross-validated, within-class-corrected). Four main conclusions emerged from our results. First, multivariate noise normalization dramatically improved classification accuracies and the reliability of dissimilarity measures. Second, LDA, SVM and WeiRD yielded high peak classification accuracies and nearly identical time courses. Third, while using classification accuracies for RSA was markedly less reliable than continuous distances, this disadvantage was ameliorated by decision-value-weighting of classification accuracies. Fourth, the cross-validated Euclidean distance provided unbiased distance estimates and highly replicable representational dissimilarity matrices. Overall, we strongly advice the use of multivariate noise normalisation as a general preprocessing step, recommend LDA, SVM and WeiRD as classifiers for decoding and highlight the cross-validated Euclidean distance as a reliable and unbiased default choice for RSA.",['matthias.guggenmos@charite.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/06/172619,biorxiv,2017,a13fb7ff-cd63-412c-87d2-e0af49595390,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/06/172619.full.pdf

Sema4D signaling induces inhibitory bouton stabilization within tens of minutes and can induce local changes in bouton density.

Consequent fate acquisition occurred as a function of both the pSMAD1 signaling strength, and induction time - consistent with the Positional-Information (PI) paradigm.

Gene expression inference with deep learning,"Yifei Chen, Yi Li, Rajiv Narayan, Aravind Subramanian, Xiaohui Xie",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2015,"Motivation:
Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease
conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping
steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing
that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-
effective strategy of profiling only  ̃1,000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to
infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program
is currently based on linear regression, limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship
between expression of genes.

Results:
We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression
of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based GEO dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our
model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across
all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms linear regression with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise
comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than linear regression in 99.97% of the target
genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which
consists of 2,921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms linear regression with 6.57% relative improvement,
and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.

Experience-dependent plasticity in accessory olfactory bulb interneurons following male-male social interaction,"Hillary L. Cansler, Marina A. Maksimova,  View ORCID ProfileJulian P. Meeks",Now published in The Journal of Neuroscience. 2017,"Chemosensory information processing in the mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) guides the expression of social behavior. After salient chemosensory encounters, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) experiences changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition at reciprocal synapses between mitral cells (MCs) and local interneurons. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain controversial. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MC-interneuron plasticity is unique to specific behaviors, such as mating, or whether it is a more general feature of the AOB circuit. Here, we describe targeted electrophysiological studies of AOB inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), many of which upregulate the immediate-early gene Arc after male-male social experience. Following the resident-intruder paradigm, Arc-expressing IGCs in acute AOB slices from resident males displayed stronger excitation than non-expressing neighbors when sensory inputs are stimulated. The increased excitability of Arc-expressing IGCs was not correlated with changes in the strength or number of excitatory synapses with MCs, but was instead associated with increased intrinsic excitability and decreased HCN channel-mediated IH currents. Consistent with increased inhibition by IGCs, MCs responded to sensory input stimulation with decreased depolarization and spiking following resident-intruder encounters. These results reveal that non-mating behaviors drive AOB inhibitory plasticity, and indicate that increased MC inhibition involves intrinsic excitability changes in Arc-expressing interneurons.",['julian.meeks@utsouthwestern.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/01/127589,biorxiv,2017,2e258f2e-15c9-447f-89dd-da95d6dc241a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/01/127589.full.pdf

Gamete fate regulatory networks have been analyzed in nematodes, flies and mammals, but only in C. elegans have terminal intrinsic regulators been identified, which include a Tob/BTG protein family member, FOG-3. Canonical Tob/BTG proteins function as monomeric adaptor proteins that link RNA binding proteins to deadenylases. To ask if FOG-3 functions similarly, we first determined its crystal structure. FOG-3 harbors a classical Tob/BTG fold, but unlike other Tob/BTG proteins, FOG-3 dimerizes and these FOG-3 dimers assemble into polymers. The importance of FOG-3 polymers to sperm fate specification was confirmed in vivo using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create mutations designed to disrupt the polymer interface. The FOG-3 surface potential is highly basic, suggesting binding to nucleic acid. We find that FOG-3 binds RNA directly with a strong preference for 3'UTRs of oogenic mRNAs.

Breaking bud: probing the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods,"Hussein A Hejase, Kevin J Liu",Now published in BMC Bioinformatics. 2016,"Background: Branching events in phylogenetic trees reflect strictly bifurcating and/or multifurcating speciation and splitting events. In the presence of gene flow, a phylogeny cannot be described by a tree but is instead a directed acyclic graph known as a phylogenetic network. Both phylogenetic trees and networks are typically reconstructed using computational analysis of multi-locus sequence data. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about two main scalability challenges: (1) dataset size in terms of the number of taxa and (2) the evolutionary divergence of the taxa in a study. The impact of both dimensions of scale on phylogenetic tree inference has been well characterized by recent studies; in contrast, the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the performance of state-of-the-art phylogenetic network inference methods on large-scale datasets using empirical data sampled from natural mouse populations and synthetic data capturing a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.

Results: We find that, as in the case of phylogenetic tree inference, the performance of leading network inference methods is negatively impacted by both dimensions of dataset scale. In general, we found that topological accuracy degrades as the number of taxa increases; a similar effect was observed with increased sequence mutation rate. The most accurate methods were probabilistic inference methods which maximize either likelihood under coalescent-based models or pseudo-likelihood approximations to the model likelihood. Furthermore, probabilistic inference methods with optimization criteria which did not make use of gene tree root and/or branch length information performed best - a result that runs contrary to widely held assumptions in the literature. The improved accuracy obtained with probabilistic inference methods comes at a computational cost in terms of runtime and main memory usage, which quickly become prohibitive as dataset size grows past thirty taxa.

Conclusions: We conclude that the state of the art of phylogenetic network inference lags well behind the scope of current phylogenomic studies. New algorithmic development is critically needed to address this methodological gap.","['kjl@msu.edu', 'hijazhu@msu.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/01/056572,biorxiv,2016,6393817c-0561-46fc-892a-4a19213a2676,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/01/056572.full.pdf

The terrestrial annelids, in spite of their ecological relevance and unique biochemical repertoire, are represented by a single rough genome draft of Eisenia fetida (North American isolate), which suggested that extensive duplications have led to a large number of HOX genes in this annelid. Herein, we report the draft genome sequence of Eisenia fetida (Indian isolate), a terrestrial redworm widely used for vermicomposting assembled using short reads and mate-pair reads. An in-depth analysis of the miRNome of the worm, showed that many miRNA gene families have also undergone extensive duplications. Genes for several important proteins such as sialidases and neurotrophins were identified by RNA sequencing of tissue samples. We also used de novo assembled RNA-Seq data to identify genes that are differentially expressed during regeneration, both in the newly regenerating cells and in the adjacent tissue. Sox4, a master regulator of TGF-beta induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was induced in the newly regenerated tissue. The regeneration of the ventral nerve cord was also accompanied by the induction of nerve growth factor and neurofilament genes. The metagenome of the worm, characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing, revealed the identity of several bacterial species that reside in the nephridia of the worm.

Expansion of the reference models into temporally transitioning systems shows that the elements of each triangle, and provenance among elements across triangles, are only identifiable if taxonomic names and concepts are precisely contextualized. The Codes of nomenclature, by mandating identifier (name) reuse but not requiring concept-specific identifier granularity, leave the challenge of framing and aligning the symbol/reference instances to human communicators who have superior cognitive abilities in this regard. Computers, in turn, can process greater volumes of narrowly framed and logically aligned data. Comparative, taxonomically referenced biological data are becoming increasingly networked and reutilized in analyses that expand their original context of generation.

Yet, we know little about how well specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques work with the degraded DNA typically extracted from museum specimens. Here, we use one type of NGS approach, sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to collect data from bird museum specimens as old as 120 years. We targeted approximately 5,000 UCE loci in 27 Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) representing three evolutionary lineages, and we collected an average of 3,749 UCE loci containing 4,460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite older specimens producing fewer and shorter loci in general, we collected thousands of markers from even the oldest specimens. More sequencing reads per individual helped to boost the number of UCE loci we recovered from older specimens, but more sequencing was not as successful at increasing the length of loci. We detected contamination in some samples and determined contamination was more prevalent in older samples that were subject to less sequencing. For the phylogeny generated from concatenated UCE loci, contamination led to incorrect placement of some individuals. In contrast, a species tree constructed from SNPs called within UCE loci correctly placed individuals into three monophyletic groups, perhaps because of the stricter analytical procedures we used for SNP calling. This study and other recent studies on the genomics of museums specimens have profound implications for natural history collections, where millions of older specimens should now be considered genomic resources.","['mccormack@oxy.edu', 'brant@faircloth-lab.org']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/02/020271,biorxiv,2015,7d4f33e2-3536-4632-8b00-d9f625d55511,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/02/020271.full.pdf

To test this idea, we examined the integration of prior and likelihood information in a simple position estimation task comparing children aged 6-11 years and adults. During development, estimation performance became closer to the statistical optimum. Children use likelihood information as well as adults but are limited in their use of priors.

Side-By-Side Analysis Of Alternative Approaches On Multi-Level RNA-Seq Data, View ORCID ProfileIrina Mohorianu,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used for RNA quantification across environmental, biological and medical sciences; it enables the description of genome-wide patterns of expression and the deduction of regulatory interactions and networks. The aim of computational analyses is to achieve an accurate output, i.e. rigorous quantification of genes/transcripts to allow a reliable prediction of differential expression (DE), despite the variable levels of noise and biases present in sequencing data. The evaluation of sequencing quality and normalization are essential components of this process.  Results: We investigate the discriminative power of existing approaches for the quality checking of mRNA-seq data and also propose additional, quantitative, quality checks. To accommodate the analysis of a nested, multi-level design using data on D. melanogaster, we incorporated the sample layout into the analysis. We describe a “subsampling without replacement”-based normalization and identification of DE that accounts for the experimental design i.e. the hierarchy and amplitude of effect sizes within samples. We also evaluate the differential expression call in comparison to existing approaches. To assess the broader applicability of these methods, we applied this series of steps to a published set of H. sapiens mRNA-seq samples.

Building realistic assemblages with a Joint Species Distribution Model, View ORCID ProfileDavid J. Harris,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"1. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict how individual species---and whole assemblages of species---will respond to a changing environment. Until now, these models have either assumed (1) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated, or (2) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modeling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties.

2. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network,  called mistnet, which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike recently proposed Joint SDMs, mistnet can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors.

3. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were nearly 50,000 times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species models.

4. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analyzing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured---and perhaps unanticipated---environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, mistnet identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of incomplete data sets to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.",['davharris@ucdavis.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/04/09/003947,biorxiv,2014,0f997695-2866-40e4-98d8-7a184b7e325f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/04/09/003947.full.pdf

Sepsis Reconsidered: Identifying Novel Metrics For Behavioral Landscape Characterization With A High-Performance Computing Implementation Of An Agent-Based Model,"Chase Cockrell, Gary An",Now published in Journal of Theoretical Biology. 2017,"Objectives: Sepsis affects nearly 1 million people in the United States per year, has a mortality rate of 28-50% and requires more than $20 billion a year in hospital costs. Over a quarter century of research has not yielded a single reliable diagnostic test or a directed therapeutic agent for sepsis. Central to this insufficiency is the fact that sepsis remains a clinical/physiological diagnosis representing a multitude of molecularly heterogeneous pathological trajectories. Advances in computational capabilities offered by High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms call for an evolution in the investigation of sepsis to attempt to define the boundaries of traditional research (bench, clinical and computational) through the use of computational proxy models. We present a novel investigatory and analytical approach, derived from how HPC resources and simulation are used in the physical sciences, to identify the epistemic boundary conditions of the study of clinical sepsis via the use of a proxy agent-based model of systemic inflammation.  Design: Current predictive models for sepsis use correlative methods are limited by patient heterogeneity and data sparseness. We address this issue by using an HPC version of a system-level validated agent-based model of sepsis, the Innate Immune Response ABM (IIRBM), as a proxy system in order to identify boundary conditions for the possible behavioral space for sepsis. We then apply advanced analysis derived from the study of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) to identify novel means for characterizing system behavior and providing insight into the tractability of traditional investigatory methods.  Results: The behavior space of the IIRABM was examined by simulating over 70 million sepsis patients for up to 90 days for the following parameters: cardio-respiratory-metabolic resilience; microbial invasiveness; microbial toxigenesis; and degree of nosocomial exposure. In addition to using established methods for describing parameter space, we developed two novel methods for characterizing the behavior of a RDS: Probabilistic Basins of Attraction (PBoA) and Stochastic Trajectory Analysis (STA). Computationally generated behavioral landscapes demonstrated attractor structures around stochastic regions of behavior that could be described in a complementary fashion through use of PBoA and STA. The stochasticity of the boundaries of the attractors highlights the challenge for correlative attempts to characterize and classify clinical sepsis.  Conclusions: HPC simulations of models like the IIRABM can be used to generate approximations of the behavior space of sepsis to both establish “boundaries of futility” with respect to existing investigatory approaches and apply system engineering principles to investigate the general dynamic properties of sepsis to provide a pathway for developing control strategies. The issues that bedevil the study and treatment of sepsis, namely clinical data sparseness and inadequate experimental sampling of system behavior space, are fundamental to nearly all biomedical research, manifesting in the “Crisis of Reproducibility“ at all levels. HPC-augmented simulation-based research offers an investigatory strategy more consistent with that seen in the physical sciences (which combine experiment, theory and simulation), and an opportunity to utilize the leading advances in HPC, namely deep machine learning and evolutionary computing, to form the basis of an iterative scientific process to meet the full promise of Precision Medicine (right drug, right patient, right time).",['Docgca@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/24/141804,biorxiv,2017,750d66a2-7b81-4866-8e55-b837eb80d2a6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/24/141804.full.pdf

Reproducible Computational Workflows with Continuous Analysis," View ORCID ProfileBrett K Beaulieu-Jones,  View ORCID ProfileCasey S Greene",Now published in Nature Biotechnology. 2016,"Reproducing experiments is vital to science. Being able to replicate, validate and extend previous work also speeds new research projects. Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed ""continuous analysis"" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code.

Language impairments in ASD resulting from a failed domestication of the human brain,"Antonio Benitez-Burraco, Wanda Lattanzi, Elliot Murphy",Now published in Frontiers in Neuroscience. 2016,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders entailing social and cognitive deficits, including marked problems with language. Numerous genes have been associated with ASD, but it is unclear how language deficits arise from gene mutation or dysregulation. It is also unclear why ASD shows such high prevalence within human populations. Interestingly, the emergence of a modern faculty of language has been hypothesised to be linked to changes in the human brain/skull, but also to the process of self-domestication of the human species. It is our intention to show that people with ASD exhibit less marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also discuss many ASD candidates represented among the genes known to be involved in the domestication syndrome (the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated mammals, which seemingly results from the hypofunction of the neural crest) and among the set of genes involved in language function closely connected to them. Moreover, many of these genes show altered expression profiles in the brain of autists. In addition, some candidates for domestication and language-readiness show the same expression profile in people with ASD and chimps in different brain areas involved in language processing. Similarities regarding the brain oscillatory behaviour of these areas can be expected too. We conclude that ASD may represent an abnormal ontogenetic itinerary for the human faculty of language resulting in part from changes in genes important for the domestication syndrome and, ultimately, from the normal functioning of the neural crest.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/28/046037,biorxiv,2016,c9e3dbd3-7174-4617-9d3e-4ddd2f224e9c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/28/046037.full.pdf
Comprehensive discovery of subsample gene expression components by information explanation: therapeutic implications in cancer,"Shirley Pepke, Greg Ver Steeg",Now published in BMC Medical Genomics. 2016,"Background
De novo inference of clinically relevant gene function relationships from tumor RNA-seq remains a challenging task. Current methods typically either partition patient samples into a few subtypes or rely upon analysis of pairwise gene correlations (co-expression) that will miss some groups in noisy data. Leveraging higher dimensional information can be expected to increase the power to discern targetable pathways, but this is commonly thought to be an intractable computational problem. 

Methods
In this work we adapt a recently developed machine learning algorithm, CorEx, that efficiently optimizes over multivariate mutual information for sensitive detection of complex gene relationships. The algorithm can be iteratively applied to generate a hierarchy of latent factors. Patients are stratified relative to each factor and combinatoric survival analyses are performed and interpreted in the context of biological function annotations and protein network interactions that might be utilized to match patients to multiple therapies. 

Results
Analysis of ovarian tumor RNA-seq samples demonstrates the algorithm's power to infer well over one hundred biologically interpretable gene cohorts, several times more than standard methods such as hierarchical clustering and k-means. The CorEx factor hierarchy is also informative, with related but distinct gene clusters grouped by upper nodes. Some latent factors correlate with patient survival, including one for a pathway connected with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer that is regulated by a potentially druggable microRNA. Further, combinations of factors lead to a synergistic survival advantage in some cases.
 
Conclusions
In contrast to studies that attempt to partition patients into a small number of subtypes (typically 4 or fewer) for treatment purposes, our approach utilizes subgroup information for combinatoric transcriptional phenotyping. Considering only the 66 gene expression groups that are both found to have significant Gene Ontology enrichment and are small enough to indicate specific drug targets implies a computational phenotype for ovarian cancer that allows for 366 possible patient profiles, enabling truly personalized treatment. The findings here demonstrate a new technique that sheds light on the complexity of gene expression dependencies in tumors and could eventually enable the use of patient RNA-seq profiles for selection of personalized and effective cancer treatments.","['1spepke@lyridllc.com', '2gregv@isi.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/19/043257,biorxiv,2016,791b095e-97d3-49fa-8079-9af1b35b7218,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/19/043257.full.pdf

A Radically New Theory of how the Brain Represents and Computes with Probabilities, View ORCID ProfileRod Rinkus,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The brain is believed to implement probabilistic reasoning and to represent information via population, or distributed, coding. Most previous population-based probabilistic (PPC) theories share several basic properties: 1) continuous-valued neurons; 2) fully (densely)-distributed codes, i.e., all (most) units participate in every code; 3) graded synapses; 4) rate coding; 5) units have innate unimodal tuning functions (TFs); 6) intrinsically noisy units; and 7) noise/correlation is considered harmful. We present a radically different theory that assumes: 1) binary units; 2) only a small subset of units, i.e., a sparse distributed code (SDC) (cell assembly, ensemble), comprises any individual code; 3) binary synapses; 4) signaling formally requires only single (first) spikes; 5) units initially have completely flat TFs (all weights zero); 6) units are not inherently noisy; but rather 7) noise is a resource generated/used to cause similar inputs to map to similar codes, controlling a tradeoff between storage capacity and embedding the input space statistics in the pattern of intersections over stored codes, indirectly yielding correlation patterns. The theory, Sparsey, was introduced 20 years ago as a canonical cortical circuit/algorithm model, but not elaborated as an alternative to PPC theories. Here, we show that the active SDC simultaneously represents both the most similar/likely input and the coarsely-ranked distribution over all stored inputs (hypotheses). Crucially, Sparsey's code selection algorithm (CSA), used for both learning and inference, achieves this with a single pass over the weights for each successive item of a sequence, thus performing spatiotemporal pattern learning/inference with a number of steps that remains constant as the number of stored items increases. We also discuss our approach as a radically new implementation of graphical probability modeling.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/13/162941,biorxiv,2017,329cda06-17e2-4241-8bdb-8000818e9755,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/13/162941.full.pdf
Statistical Inference of a Convergent Antibody Repertoire Response to Influenza Vaccine,"Nicolas Strauli, Ryan Hernandez",Now published in Genome Medicine. 2015,"Background:
Vaccines dramatically affect an individual’s adaptive immune system, and thus provide an excellent means to study human immunity. Upon vaccination, the B cells that express antibodies (Abs) that happen to bind the vaccine are stimulated to proliferate and undergo mutagenesis at their Ab locus. This process may alter the composition of B cell lineages within an individual, which are known collectively as the antibody repertoire (AbR). Antibodies are also highly expressed in whole blood, potentially enabling unbiased RNA sequencing technologies to query this diversity. Less is known about the diversity of AbR responses across individuals to a given vaccine and if individuals tend to yield a similar response to the same antigenic stimulus.

Methods:
Here we implement a bioinformatic pipeline that extracts the AbR information from a time-series RNA-seq dataset of 5 patients who were administered a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). We harness the detailed time-series nature of this dataset and use methods based in functional data analysis (FDA) to identify the B cell lineages that respond to the vaccine. We then design and implement rigorous statistical tests in order to ask whether or not these patients exhibit a convergent AbR response to the same TIV. 

Results:
We find that high-resolution time-series data can be used to help identify the Ab lineages that respond to an antigenic stimulus, and that this response can exhibit a convergent nature across patients inoculated with the same vaccine. However, correlations in AbR diversity among individuals prior to inoculation can confound inference of a convergent signal unless it is taken into account.

Conclusions:
We developed a framework to identify the elements of an AbR that respond to an antigen. This information could be used to understand the diversity of different immune responses in different individuals, as well as to gauge the effectiveness of the immune response to a given stimulus within an individual.  We also present a framework for testing a convergent hypothesis between AbRs; a hypothesis that is more difficult to test than previously appreciated. Our discovery of a convergent signal suggests that similar epitopes do select for antibodies with similar sequence characteristics.","['nicolas.strauli@ucsf.edu', 'ryan.hernandez@ucsf.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/20/025098,biorxiv,2015,7df0e743-abc5-4913-83b3-7715a5cc35a9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/20/025098.full.pdf

Here, we show that an increasing rostral-caudal (RC) gradient of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is commensurate with a decrease in active neurons along the RC axis following exploration of a novel odor environment. This inhibitory gradient is supported by somatostatin interneurons that provide an opposing, rostrally-biased, gradient of inhibition to interneurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic modulation of somatostatin cells neutralizes the inhibitory gradient onto pyramidal cells.

Our analysis of PRO-seq data for K562 cells reveals dramatic transcriptional effects soon after celastrol treatment at a broad collection of both coding and noncoding transcription units.  This transcriptional response occurred in two major waves, one within 10 minutes, and a second 40-60 minutes after treatment.  Transcriptional activity was generally repressed by celastrol, but one distinct group of genes, enriched for roles in the heat shock response, displayed strong activation.  Using a regression approach, we identified key transcription factors that appear to drive these transcriptional responses, including members of the E2F and RFX families.  We also found sequence-based evidence that particular TFs drive the activation of enhancers.  We observed increased polymerase pausing at both genes and enhancers, suggesting that pause release may be widely inhibited during the celastrol response.

As a result, downstream analysis is required to uncover the locations where proteins of interest bind.

The formation of a metastable trans-complex, catalyzed by HOPS and its SM subunit Vps33, is followed by subsequent zippering transitions that increase the probability of fusion. Operating independently of Sec18 catalysis, Sec17 either inhibits or stimulates SNARE-mediated fusion. If HOPS or Vps33 are absent, Sec17 inhibits fusion at an early stage. Thus, HOPS and Vps33 accelerate SNARE zippering, particularly in the presence of otherwise inhibitory Sec17. Once SNAREs are partially-zipped, Sec17 promotes fusion in either the presence or absence of HOPS, but with faster kinetics when HOPS is absent. Our data further indicate that Sec17 promotes fusion both through its direct penetration of the membrane and by enhancing C-terminal SNARE zippering.

This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, 
from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map.  
We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), 
in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. 
We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, 
with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples.

is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.","['agbradburd@ucdavis.edu', 'bpralph@usc.edu', 'cgmcoop@ucdavis.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/24/013474,biorxiv,2015,8d495dd4-4be5-4645-9d71-da975cf51e6e,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/24/013474.full.pdf

The geometries and topologies of leaves, flowers, roots, shoots and their spatial arrangements have fascinated plant biologists and mathematicians alike. Beyond providing aesthetic inspiration, quantifying plant morphology has become pressing in an era of climate change and a growing human population. Modifying plant morphology, through molecular biology and breeding, aided by a mathematical perspective, is critical to improving agriculture, and the monitoring of ecosystems with fewer natural resources. In this white paper, we begin with an overview of the mathematical models applied to quantify patterning in plants. We then explore fundamental challenges that remain unanswered concerning plant morphology, from the barriers preventing the prediction of phenotype from genotype to modeling the movement of leafs in air streams. We end with a discussion concerning the incorporation of plant morphology into educational programs. This strategy focuses on synthesizing biological and mathematical approaches and ways to facilitate research advances through outreach, cross-disciplinary training, and open science. This white paper arose from bringing mathematicians and biologists together at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) workshop titled Morphological Plant Modeling: Unleashing Geometric and Topological Potential within the Plant Sciences held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in September, 2015.

"Why Does the Neocortex Have Layers and Columns, A Theory of Learning the 3D Structure of the World","Jeff Hawkins,  View ORCID ProfileSubutai Ahmad,  View ORCID ProfileYuwei Cui",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Neocortical regions are organized into columns and layers. Connections between layers run mostly perpendicular to the surface suggesting a columnar functional organization. Some layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensor data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.","['jhawkins@numenta.com', 'sahmad@numenta.com', 'ycui@numenta.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/162263,biorxiv,2017,dce97e2b-9f1a-4c6b-821a-bfce06fd338a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/162263.full.pdf

In humans, spindles can be classified as either slow or fast, but large individual differences in spindle frequency as well as methodological difficulties have hindered progress towards understanding their function. Using two nights of high-density electroencephalography recordings from healthy individuals, we first characterize the individual variability of NREM spectra and demonstrate the difficulty of determining subject-specific spindle frequencies. We then introduce a novel spatial filtering approach that can reliably separate subject-specific spindle activity into slow and fast components that are stable across nights and across N2 and N3 sleep. We then proceed to provide detailed analyses of the topographical expression of individualized slow and fast spindle activity. Group-level analyses conform to known spatial properties of spindles, but also uncover novel differences between sleep stages and spindle classes. Moreover, subject-specific examinations reveal that individual topographies show considerable variability that is stable across nights. Finally, we demonstrate that topographical maps depend nontrivially on the spindle metric employed.

While most isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii belong to one of three major lineages (VNI, VNII, and VNB), some haploid isolates show hybrid ancestry including some that appear to have recently interbred, based on the detection of large blocks of each ancestry across each chromosome. Many isolates display evidence of aneuploidy, which was detected for all chromosomes. In diploid isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A/A) and of hybrids with C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype A/D) such aneuploidies have resulted in loss of heterozygosity, where a chromosomal region is represented by the genotype of only one parental isolate.

In Amazonian birds, differences in habitat preference are an important component of ecological diversity. A subset of Amazonian birds is restricted to forest edge and open forest along floodplains, whereas another subset occurs only in the interior of tall, upland forest. Here, we examine the link between habitat and evolutionary metrics using 20 pairs of closely related and co-distributed bird species in which one member of the pair occurs primarily in forest edge and floodplains, and the other occurs in upland forest interior. We use standardized geographic sampling and genomic data from the same set of 2,416 independent markers to estimate genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history in each species. We find that species of upland forest have higher genetic diversity, greater divergence across the landscape, more genetically distinct populations, and deeper gene histories than floodplain species.

We compare the performances of both encoding methods using three sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot encoding method but with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the one-hot encoding performance is quite consistent across various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix representation performs best in some of the evaluated datasets.

It is therefore imperative to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression from non-model malaria parasites and how this varies across host individuals. Here, we used high-throughput Illumina RNA-sequencing on blood from wild-caught Eurasian siskins experimentally infected with a clonal strain of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium ashfordi (lineage GRW2). By using a multi-step approach to filter out host transcripts, we successfully assembled the blood-stage transcriptome of P. ashfordi.

We quantified gene expression levels of all parasite transcripts across three hosts during two infection stages - peak and decreasing parasitemia. Interestingly, parasites from the same host displayed remarkably similar expression profiles during different infection stages, but showed large differences across hosts, indicating that P. ashfordi may adjust its gene expression to specific host individuals. We further show that the majority of transcripts are most similar to the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and a large number of red blood cell invasion genes were discovered, suggesting evolutionary conserved invasion strategies between mammalian and avian Plasmodium.

We provide evidence that the evolution of a highly folded neocortex, as observed in humans, requires the traversal of a threshold of ∼109 neurons, and that species above and below the threshold exhibit a bimodal distribution of physiological and life-history traits, establishing two phenotypic groups. We identify, using discrete mathematical models, proliferative divisions of progenitors in the basal compartment of the developing neocortex as evolutionarily necessary and sufficient for generating a fourteen-fold increase in daily prenatal neuron production and thus traversal of the neuronal threshold.

Neural source dynamics of brain responses to continuous stimuli: speech processing from acoustics to comprehension," View ORCID ProfileChristian Brodbeck, Alessandro Presacco,  View ORCID ProfileJonathan Z. Simon",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Human experience often involves continuous sensory information that unfolds over time. This is true in particular for speech comprehension, where continuous acoustic signals are processed over seconds or even minutes. We show that brain responses to such continuous stimuli can be investigated in detail, for magnetoencephalography (MEG) data by combining linear kernel estimation with minimum norm source localization. Previous research has shown that the requirement to average data over many trials can be overcome by approximating the brain response as the result of a linear convolution of the stimulus and a kernel, or response function, and estimating a kernel that predicts the response from the stimulus. However, such analysis has been typically restricted to sensor space. Here we demonstrate that this analysis can also be performed in neural source space, and without sacrificing the millisecond precision of the acquired MEG data. We first computed distributed minimum norm current source estimates for continuous MEG recordings, and then computed response functions for the current estimate at each source element, using the boosting algorithm with cross-validation. Permutation tests can then assess the significance of individual predictor variables as well as features of the corresponding spatio-temporal response functions. We demonstrate the viability of this technique by computing spatio-temporal response functions for speech stimuli, using predictor variables reflecting acoustic, lexical and semantic processing. Results indicate that processes related to comprehension of continuous speech can be differentiated anatomically as well as temporally: acoustic information engaged auditory cortex at short latencies, as well as a response over the central sulcus, possibly related to somatosensory/motor cortex involvement in speech perception; lexical frequency was associated with a left-lateralized response in auditory cortex and subsequent bilateral frontal activity; and semantic composition was associated with bilateral anterior temporal and frontal brain activity. We conclude that this technique can be used to study the neural processing of continuous stimuli in time and anatomical space with the millisecond temporal resolution of MEG.

A unifying motif for spatial and directional surround suppression,"Liu D. Liu, Kenneth D. Miller, Christopher C. Pack",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. While the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the primate visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacologically manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.",['christopher.pack@mcgill.ca'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/24/180125,biorxiv,2017,192be92a-bdb4-425c-8f2f-2bd107a45d6c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/24/180125.full.pdf

T-cell receptor diversity results from an initial random DNA editing process, called VDJ recombination, followed by functional selection of cells according to the interaction of their surface receptors with self and foreign antigenic peptides. To quantify the effect of selection on the highly variable elements of the receptor, we apply a probabilistic maximum likelihood approach to the analysis of high-throughput sequence data from the β-chain of human T-cell receptors. We quantify selection factors for V and J gene choice, and for the length  and amino-acid composition of the variable region. Our approach is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in the recombination process. Inferred selection factors differ little between donors, or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared between donors is well-predicted by the model, indicating a purely stochastic origin of such ""public"" sequences. We find a significant correlation between biases induced by VDJ recombination and our inferred selection factors, together with a reduction of diversity during selection.

Accordingly, protein kinases have been subject to intense investigations in cancer research, to understand their role in oncogenesis and to discover new therapeutic targets. Despite great advances, an understanding of kinase dysfunctioning in cancer is far from complete.
A powerful tool to investigate phosphorylation is mass-spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics, which enables the identification of thousands of phosphorylated peptides in a single experiment. Since every phosphorylation event results from the activity of a protein kinase, high-coverage phosphoproteomics data should indirectly contain comprehensive information about the activity of protein kinases.
In this chapter, we discuss the use of computational methods to predict kinase activity scores from MS-based phosphoproteomics data. We start with a short explanation of the fundamental features of the phosphoproteomics data acquisition process from the perspective of the computational analysis. Next, we briefly review the existing databases with experimentally verified kinase-substrate relationships and present a set of bioinformatic tools to discover novel kinase targets. We then introduce different methods to infer kinase activities from phosphoproteomics data and these kinase-substrate relationships. We illustrate their application with a detailed protocol of one of the methods, KSEA (Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis).

Genetically targeted 3D visualisation of Drosophila neurons under Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microscopy using miniSOG,"Julian Ng, Alyssa Browning, Lorenz Lechner, Masako Terada, Gillian Howard, Gregory Jefferis",Now published in Scientific Reports. 2016,"Large dimension, high-resolution imaging is important for neural circuit visualisation as neurons have both long- and short-range patterns: from axons and dendrites to the numerous synapses at their endings. Electron Microscopy (EM) is the favoured approach for synaptic resolution imaging but how such structures can be segmented from high-density images within large volume datasets remains challenging. 
Fluorescent probes are widely used to localise synapses, identify cell-types and in tracing studies. The equivalent EM approach would benefit visualising such labelled structures from within sub-cellular, cellular, tissue and neuroanatomical contexts.
Here we developed genetically-encoded, electron-dense markers using miniSOG. We demonstrate their ability in 1) labelling cellular sub-compartments of genetically-targeted neurons, 2) generating contrast under different EM modalities, and 3) segmenting labelled structures from EM volumes using computer-assisted strategies. We also tested non-destructive X-ray imaging on whole Drosophila brains to evaluate contrast staining. This enables us to target specific regions for EM volume acquisition.","['jtln2@cam.ac.uk', 'jefferis@mrcQlmb.cam.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/070755,biorxiv,2016,7779f336-0bca-4a88-8a80-640cde070ed4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/22/070755.full.pdf
Ecological Interactions and the Netflix Problem," View ORCID ProfilePhilippe Desjardins-Proulx,  View ORCID ProfileIdaline Laigle,  View ORCID ProfileTimothee Poisot,  View ORCID ProfileDominique Gravel",Now published in PeerJ. 2017,"Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an
incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques
have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or
abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special
emphasis on recommendation, along with other machine learning techniques.
Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict if
a customer would like a product given the preferences of similar customers.
These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological
interactions since they focus on positive-only data. We also explore how the
$K$ nearest neighbour approach can be used with both positive and negative
information, in which case the goal of the algorithm is to fill missing entries
from a matrix (imputation). By removing a prey from a predator, we find that
recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first
try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the
results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised
learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high
accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary
interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given
only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny.
These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in
the absence of traits, using only information about other species'
interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base
their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species'
interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity
measures specialized to ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using
richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.",['philippe.desjardins.proulx@usherbrooke.ca'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/19/089771,biorxiv,2017,e517c85f-1131-4b64-97ae-94d01ed628fb,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/19/089771.full.pdf

Explicit modeling of ancestry improves polygenic risk scores and BLUP prediction,"Chia-Yen Chen, Jiali Han, David J. Hunter, Peter Kraft, Alkes L. Price",Now published in Genetic Epidemiology. 2014,"Polygenic prediction using genome-wide SNPs can provide high prediction accuracy for complex traits. Here, we investigate the question of how to account for genetic ancestry when conducting polygenic prediction. We show that the accuracy of polygenic prediction in structured populations may be partly due to genetic ancestry. However, we hypothesized that explicitly modeling ancestry could improve polygenic prediction accuracy. We analyzed three GWAS of hair color, tanning ability and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in European Americans (sample size from 7,440 to 9,822) and considered two widely used polygenic prediction approaches: polygenic risk scores (PRS) and Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP). We compared polygenic prediction without correction for ancestry to polygenic prediction with ancestry as a separate component in the model. In 10-fold cross-validation using the PRS approach, the R2 for hair color increased by 66% (0.0456 to 0.0755; p<10-16), the R2 for tanning ability increased by 123% (0.0154 to 0.0344; p<10-16) and the liability-scale R2 for BCC increased by 68% (0.0138 to 0.0232; p<10-16) when explicitly modeling ancestry, which prevents ancestry effects from entering into each SNP effect and being over-weighted. Surprisingly, explicitly modeling ancestry produces a similar improvement when using the BLUP approach, which fits all SNPs simultaneously in a single variance component and causes ancestry to be under-weighted. We validate our findings via simulations, which show that the differences in prediction accuracy will increase in magnitude as sample sizes increase. In summary, our results show that explicitly modeling ancestry can be important in both PRS and BLUP prediction.","['aprice@hsph.harvard.edu', 'cychen@mail.harvard.edu', 'aprice@hsph.harvard.edu', 'cychen@mail.harvard.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/12/03/012005,biorxiv,2014,804d311a-c5b7-4c47-98f8-4a0db3a8ea40,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/12/03/012005.full.pdf

Effects of variable mutation rates and epistasis on the distribution of allele frequencies in humans,"Arbel Harpak, Anand Bhaskar, Jonathan K Pritchard",Now published in PLOS Genetics. 2016,"The site frequency spectrum (SFS) has long been used to study demographic history and natural selection.  Here, we extend this summary by examining the SFS conditional on the alleles found at the same site in other species.  We refer to this extension as the ""phylogenetically-conditioned SFS"" or cSFS.  Using recent large-sample data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), combined with primate genome sequences, we find that human variants that occurred independently in closely related primate lineages are at higher frequencies in humans than variants with parallel substitutions in more distant primates. We show that this effect is largely due to sites with elevated mutation rates causing significant departures from the widely-used infinite sites mutation model. Our analysis also suggests substantial variation in mutation rates even among mutations involving the same nucleotide changes. We additionally find evidence for epistatic effects on the cSFS: namely, that parallel primate substitutions at nonsynonymous sites are more informative about constraint in humans when the parallel substitution occurs in a closely related species. In summary, we show that variable mutation rates and local sequence context are important determinants of the SFS in humans.",['arbelh@stanford.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/26/048421,biorxiv,2016,89519c3e-277f-44b8-a755-ca4136b5a9d1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/26/048421.full.pdf
Adaptive Cortical Parcellations for Source Reconstructed EEG/MEG Connectomes," View ORCID ProfileSeyedeh-Rezvan Farahibozorg,  View ORCID ProfileRichard N Henson,  View ORCID ProfileOlaf Hauk",Now published in NeuroImage. 2017,"There is growing interest in the rich temporal and spectral properties of the functional connectome of the brain that are provided by Electro- and Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the problem of leakage between brain sources that arises when reconstructing brain activity from EEG/MEG recordings outside the head makes it difficult to distinguish true connections from spurious connections, even when connections are based on measures that ignore zero-lag dependencies. In particular, standard anatomical parcellations for potential cortical sources tend to over- or under-sample the real spatial resolution of EEG/MEG. By using information from cross-talk functions (CTFs) that objectively describe leakage for a given sensor configuration and distributed source reconstruction method, we introduce methods for optimising the number of parcels while simultaneously minimising the leakage between them. More specifically, we compare two image segmentation algorithms: 1) a split-and-merge (SaM) algorithm based on standard anatomical parcellations and 2) a region growing (RG) algorithm based on all the brain vertices with no prior parcellation. Interestingly, when applied to minimum-norm reconstructions for EEG/MEG configurations from real data, both algorithms yielded approximately 70 parcels despite their different starting points, suggesting that this reflects the resolution limit of this particular sensor configuration and reconstruction method. Importantly, when compared against standard anatomical parcellations, resolution matrices of adaptive parcellations showed notably higher sensitivity and distinguishability of parcels. Furthermore, extensive simulations of realistic networks under various circumstances revealed significant improvements in network reconstruction accuracies, particularly in reducing false leakage-induced connections. Adaptive parcellations therefore allow a more accurate reconstruction of functional EEG/MEG connectomes.",['rezvan.farahibozorg@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/097774,biorxiv,2017,19549ee5-7d0e-41ee-bf7e-dd3aa1b3211a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/097774.full.pdf
Sensitivity analysis based ranking reveals unknown biological hypotheses for down regulated genes in time buffer during administration of PORCN-WNT inhibitor ETC-1922159 in CRC, View ORCID ProfileShriprakash Sinha,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: The search and wet lab testing of unknown/unexplored/untested biological hypotheses in the form of combinations of various intra/extracellular factors that are involved in a signaling pathway, costs a lot in terms of time, investment and energy. Currently, a major problem in biology is to cherry pick the combinations based on expert advice, literature survey or guesses to investigate a particular combinatorial hypothesis.  Methods: In a recent development of the PORCN-WNT inhibitor ETC-1922159 for colorectal cancer, a list of down-regulated genes were recorded in a time buffer after the administration of the drug. The regulation of the genes were recorded individually but it is still not known which higher (≥ 2) order interactions might be playing a greater role after the administration of the drug. In order to reveal the priority of these higher order interactions among the down-regulated genes or the likely unknown biological hypotheses, a search engine was developed based on the sensitivity indices of the higher order interactions that were ranked using a support vector ranking algorithm and sorted.  Results: For example, LGR family (Wnt signal enhancer) is known to neutralize RNF43 (Wnt inhibitor). After the administration of ETC-1922159 it was found that using HSIC (and rbf, linear and laplace variants of kernel) the rankings of the interaction between LGR5-RNF43 were 61, 114 and 85 respectively. Rankings for LGR6-RNF43 were 1652, 939 and 805 respectively. The down-regulation of LGR family after the drug treatment is evident in these rankings as it takes bottom priorities for LGR5-RNF43 interaction. The LGR6-RNF43 takes higher ranking than LGR5-RNF43, indicating that it might not be playing a greater role as LGR5 during the Wnt enhancing signals. These rankings confirm the efficacy of the proposed search engine design.  Conclusion: Prioritized unknown biological hypothesis form the basis of further wet lab tests with the aim to reduce the cost of (1) wet lab experiments (2) combinatorial search and (3) lower the testing time for biologist who search for influential interactions in a vast combinatorial search forest. From in silico perspective, a framework for a search engine now exists which can generate rankings for nth order interactions in Wnt signaling pathway, thus revealing unknown/untested/unexplored biological hypotheses and aiding in understanding the mechanism of the pathway. The generic nature of the design can be applied to any signaling pathway or phenomena under investigation where a prioritized order of interactions among the involved factors need to be investigated for deeper understanding.

To better predict environmental change effects on ecosystems, particularly in critically sensitive regions such as high altitudes, it is imperative to recognise how their natural landscape heterogeneity works at different scales to shape habitats and sustain biotic communities prior to major changes.

We conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, in order to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems.

Three composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained they were: (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics- responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for water body size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarizing geology, slope and fractal order- all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and, (iii) topography, i.e. catchment formation type- driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. While driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept.

The findings inform on the relative contribution of scale-dependent catchment physical elements to lake ecotope and ecosystem formation in high altitude lakes, which should be considered in any assessment of potentially major deleterious effects due to environmental/climate change.","['zaharescu@email.arizona.edu', 'zaha_dragos@yahoo.com', 'p.hooda@kingston.ac.uk', 'bcarmen@email.arizona.edu', 'apalanca@uvigo.es']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/07/034405,biorxiv,2016,87c4f9ec-a0e7-424d-abfb-0d82178d29f5,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/07/034405.full.pdf

Polo kinase phosphorylation determines C. elegans centrosome size and density by biasing SPD-5 toward an assembly-competent conformation,"Oliver Wueseke, David Zwicker, Anne Schwager, Yao Liang Wong, Karen Oegema, Frank Julicher, Anthony A Hyman,  View ORCID ProfileJeffrey Woodruff",Now published in Biology Open. 2016,"Centrosomes are major microtubule-organizing centers composed of centrioles surrounded by an extensive proteinacious layer called the pericentriolar material (PCM). In C. elegans  embryos, the mitotic PCM expands by Polo-kinase (PLK-1) phosphorylation-accelerated assembly of SPD-5 molecules into supramolecular scaffolds. However, how PLK-1 phosphorylation regulates SPD-5 assembly is not known. We found that a mutant version of SPD-5 that is insensitive to PLK-1 phosphorylation (SPD-54A) could localize to PCM but was unable to rescue the reduction in PCM size and density when wild-type SPD-5 levels were decreased. In vitro, purified SPD-54A self-assembled into functional supramolecular scaffolds over long time scales, suggesting that phosphorylation only controls the rate of SPD-5 scaffold assembly. Furthermore, the SPD-5 scaffold, once assembled, remained intact and supported microtubule nucleation in the absence of PLK-1 activity in vivo. We conclude that Polo Kinase is required for rapid assembly of the PCM scaffold but not for scaffold maintenance or function. Based on this idea, we developed a theoretical model that adequately predicted PCM growth rates in different mutant conditions in vivo. We propose that PLK-1 phosphorylation-dependent conversion of SPD-5 into an assembly-competent form underlies PCM formation in vivo and that the rate of this conversion determines final PCM size and density.",['woodruff@mpi-cbg.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/01/067223,biorxiv,2016,56cca74d-83a8-4c1b-a688-be259ee9fb42,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/01/067223.full.pdf

Manual staging is resource intensive and time consuming and considerable efforts have to be spent to ensure inter rater reliability. There is thus great interest in techniques based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC).  Methods: In this paper, we present a single EEG sensor ASSC technique based on dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5s epoch lengths. The proposed analytic scheme is demonstrated using the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database using 20 healthy young adults with repeat recordings.  Results: We achieved very high classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 96.2 (st.d. 2.2%), 94.2 (st.d. 2.3%), and 94.4 (st.d. 2.2%) across 20 folds, respectively and high mean F1-score (92%, range 90-94%) when multi-class Bayes Naive classifier was applied.

Transects were established at both field locations to count and measure rocks that may serve as retreat sites.  Surface area trials indicated that V. carolinianus selected large objects as retreat sites most often, but overall retreat site selection did not differ from that expected based on random choice weighted by cover object size.

However, the degree to which CNNs can predict temporal dynamics of visual object recognition reflected in neural measures with millisecond precision is less understood. Additionally, while deeper CNNs with higher numbers of layers perform better on automated object recognition, it is unclear if this also results into better correlation to brain responses. Here, we examined 1) to what extent CNN layers predict visual evoked responses in the human brain over time and 2) whether deeper CNNs better model brain responses. Specifically, we tested how well CNN architectures with 7 (CNN-7) and 15 (CNN-15) layers predicted electro-encephalography (EEG) responses to several thousands of natural images. Our results show that both CNN architectures correspond to EEG responses in a hierarchical spatio-temporal manner, with lower layers explaining responses early in time at electrodes overlying early visual cortex, and higher layers explaining responses later in time at electrodes overlying lateral-occipital cortex. While the explained variance of neural responses by individual layers did not differ between CNN-7 and CNN-15, combining the representations across layers resulted in improved performance of CNN-15 compared to CNN-7, but only after 150 ms after stimulus-onset. This suggests that CNN representations reflect both early (feed-forward) and late (feedback) stages of visual processing.

Assessing allele specific expression across multiple tissues from RNA-seq read data,"Matti Pirinen, Tuuli Lappalainen, Noah A Zaitlen, GTEx Consortium, Emmanouil T Dermitzakis, Peter Donnelly, Mark I McCarthy, Manuel A Rivas",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2014,"Motivation:
RNA sequencing enables allele specific expression (ASE) studies that complement standard genotype expression studies for common variants and, importantly, also allow measuring the regulatory impact of rare variants. The Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) is collecting RNA-seq data on multiple tissues of a same set of individuals and novel methods are required for the analysis of these data.

Results:
We present a statistical method to compare different patterns of ASE
across tissues and to classify genetic variants according to their
impact on the tissue-wide expression profile. We focus on strong ASE effects that we are expecting to see for protein-truncating variants, but our method can also be adjusted for other types of ASE effects.
We illustrate the method with a real data example on a tissue-wide expression profile of a variant causal for lipoid proteinosis, and with a simulation study to assess our method more generally.

Community challenges bring the combined benefits of intense collaboration, transparency and standard harmonization.

We find mediating pathways for three pulmonary diseases (asthma; bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) using pathway centrality. Mediating pathways shared by all three pulmonary disorders heavily favor inflammatory or immune responses and include specific pathways such as cytokine production, NF Kappa B, and JAK/STAT signaling.

To understand the spine voltage-current relation, we combine live cell imaging data and a model for the voltage to extract electrical properties.  We first deconvolve the genetically encoded voltage sensor expressed in hippocampal neurons and then use electro-diffusion theory, to compute the electric field and the ionic flows induced in a dendritic spine.

PEDLA: predicting enhancers with a deep learning-based algorithmic framework,"Feng Liu, Hao Li, Chao Ren, Xiaochen Bo, Wenjie Shu",Now published in Scientific Reports. 2016,"Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs.

Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues.

Understanding the regulatory interactions that underlie cell fate decisions requires characterizing TF binding sites (TFBS) across multiple cell types and conditions. Techniques, e.g. ChIP-Seq can reveal genome-wide patterns of TF binding, but typically requires laborious and costly experiments for each TF-cell-type (TFCT) condition of interest. Chromosomal accessibility assays can connect accessible chromatin in one cell type to many TFs through sequence motif mapping. Such methods, however, rarely take into account that the genomic context preferred by each factor differs from TF to TF, and from cell type to cell type. To address the differences in TF behaviors, we developed Mocap, a method that integrates chromatin accessibility, motif scores, TF footprints, CpG/GC content, evolutionary conservation and other factors in an ensemble of TFCT-specific classifiers. We show that integration of genomic features, such as CpG islands improves TFBS prediction in some TFCT. Further, we describe a method for mapping new TFCT, for which no ChIP-seq data exists, onto our ensemble of classifiers and show that our cross-sample TFBS prediction method outperforms several previously described methods.","['xchen@nyu.edu', 'rb133@nyu.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/27/083998,biorxiv,2016,7c09d4af-6778-41f0-b736-9c29c64e950c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/27/083998.full.pdf

The theory is inspired by recent experimental results showing how information about changes to output synapses can travel backward along axons to affect a neuron's inputs. In neuronal development, competition for such ``retroaxonal'' signals determines which neurons live and which die. We suggest that in adults, an analogous form of competition occurs between neurons, to supply their targets with appropriate information in exchange for a ``payment'' returned to them backward along the axon. We review experimental evidence suggesting that neurotrophins may constitute such a signaling pathway in the adult brain.
	
We construct a mathematical model, in which a small number of ``consumer'' neurons receive explicit fast error signals while a larger number of ``producer'' neurons compete to supply them with information, guided by retroaxonal signals from the consumers and from each other. We define a loss function to measure network performance and define the ``worth'' of a producer to be the increase in loss that would result if that neuron were to fall silent. We show how slow retroaxonal signals can allow producers to estimate their worth, and how these estimates allow the network to perform a form of parallel search over multiple producer cells.

By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. 
Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately as compared with increasing the sequencing depth, or reducing the number of competing mutants.

It has long been thought that these two perceptual characteristics are independent.

In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity with any readout mechanism capable of a linear transform. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches -- when conducted appropriately -- can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility.

Callaghan, Frederic Dick",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Measuring the structural composition of the cortex is critical to understanding typical development, yet few investigations in humans have charted markers in vivo that are sensitive to tissue microstructural attributes. Here, we used a well-validated quantitative MR protocol to measure four parameters (R1, MT, R2*, PD*) that differ in their sensitivity to facets of the tissue microstructural environment (R1, MT: myelin, macromolecular content; R2*: paramagnetic ions, i.e., iron; PD*: free water content). Mapping these parameters across cortical regions in a young adult cohort (18-30 years, N=93) revealed expected patterns of increased macromolecular content as well as reduced tissue water content in primary and primary adjacent cortical regions. Mapping across cortical depth within regions showed decreased expression of myelin and related processes - but increased tissue water content - when progressing from the grey/white to the grey/pial boundary, in all regions. Charting developmental change in cortical microstructure, we found that parameters with the greatest sensitivity to tissue myelin (R1 & MT) showed linear increases with age across frontal and parietal cortex (change 0.5-1.0% per year). Overlap of robust age effects for both parameters emerged in left inferior frontal, right parietal and bilateral pre-central regions.

We show that speech is supported by a largely undocumented core of structural and functional connectivity between the central sulcus (CS or primary motor and somatosensory cortex) and the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG or primary auditory cortex). Anatomically, we show that CS and TTG cortical thickness covary across individuals and that they are connected by white matter tracts. Neuroimaging network analyses confirm the functional relevance and specificity of these structural relationships. Specifically, the CS and TTG are functionally connected at rest, during natural audiovisual speech perception, and are coactive over a large variety of linguistic stimuli and tasks. Importantly, across structural and functional analyses, connectivity of regions immediately adjacent to the TTG are with premotor and prefrontal regions rather than the CS. Finally, we show that this structural/functional CS-TTG relationship is mediated by a constellation of genes associated with vocal learning and disorders of efference copy.

Thus, even for small blocks of nerve tissue, dense connectomic mapping requires the identification of millions to billions of synapses, of which about 80-90% are excitatory synapses. While the focus of connectomic data analysis has been on neurite reconstruction, synapse detection becomes limiting when datasets grow in size and dense mapping is required. Here, we report SynEM, a method for automated detection of excitatory synapses from conventionally en-bloc stained 3D electron microscopy image stacks. The approach is based on a segmentation of the image data and focuses on classifying borders between neuronal processes as synaptic or non-synaptic. SynEM yields 98% precision and recall in binary excitatory cortical connectomes with no user interaction. It scales to large volumes of cortical neuropil, plausibly even whole-brain datasets.

Predicting the impact of non-coding variants on DNA methylation,"Haoyang Zeng, David K.

However, our present inability to predict the effect of genome sequence variation on DNA methylation precludes a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of non-coding variation.  We introduce CpGenie, a sequence-based framework that learns a regulatory code of DNA methylation using a deep convolutional neural network and uses this network to predict the impact of sequence variation on proximal CpG site DNA methylation.  CpGenie produces allele-specific DNA methylation prediction with single-nucleotide sensitivity that enables accurate prediction of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL).

We carried out a genome-wide screen to systematically dissect the regulation of the euchromatic state of ES cells. The results reveal that activity of cellular growth pathways, prominently protein synthesis, perpetuates the euchromatic state and hypertranscription of ES cells. Acute, mild inhibition of translation results in rapid depletion of euchromatic marks in ES cells and blastocysts, concurrent with delocalization of RNA polymerase II and reduction in nascent transcription. Remarkably, reduced translational output leads to rewiring of open chromatin within 3 hours, including decreased accessibility at a subset of active developmental enhancers and increased accessibility at histone genes and transposable elements. Using a proteome-scale analysis, we show that several euchromatin regulators are unstable proteins and thus continuously depend on a high translational output.

This is particularly true for studies of neural circuits where neurons form sub-micron synapses but have arbors that may span millimeters in length. Traditionally labeling is achieved by immunofluorescence; however diffusion of antibody molecules (>100 kDa) is slow and often results in uneven labeling with very poor penetration into the centre of thick specimens; these limitations can be partially addressed by extending staining protocols to over a week (Drosophila brain) and months (mice). Recently we developed an alternative approach using genetically encoded chemical tags CLIP, SNAP, Halo and TMP for tissue labeling; this resulted in >100 fold increase in labeling speed in both mice and Drosophila, at the expense of a considerable drop in absolute sensitivity when compared to optimized immunofluorescence staining. We now present a second generation of UAS and LexA responsive CLIP, SNAP and Halo chemical labeling reagents for flies. These multimerized tags with translational enhancers have up to 64 fold increase in sensitivity over first generation reagents. In addition we developed a suite of conditional reporters (4xSNAP tag and CLIP-SNAP-Halo) that are activated by the DNA recombinase Bxb1. Our new reporters can be used with weak and strong GAL4 and LexA drivers and enable stochastic, intersectional and multicolor Brainbow labeling.

We demonstrate our method on a set of variant calls obtained from 642 African-ancestry genomes from the The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA), sequenced to high depth (~30X).

Results: We have applied our classifier to compare call sets generated with different calling methods, including both single-sample and multi-sample callers.

Since most NGS sequencing data is accompanied by genotype data for the same samples, our method can be trained on each dataset to provide a more accurate computational validation of site calls compared to generic methods.

We tested this alternative directly by measuring spiking activity in populations of primary visual cortical (V1) neurons in rhesus monkeys performing different visual discrimination tasks on the same set of visual inputs. We found that the structure of rsc (the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed dramatically with task instruction, despite identical retinal input. This demonstrates that rsc structure primarily reflects feedback dynamics engaged by the task, not noise in sensory afferents.

Unlike variation involving single nucleotide changes, data on the variation of copy number is difficult to collect and few tools exist for analyzing the variation between individuals. The immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) locus, which plays an integral role in the adaptive immune response, is an example of a genomic region that is known to vary in gene copy number. Lack of standard methods to genotype this region prevents it from being included in association studies and is holding back the growing field of antibody repertoire analysis. Here, we establish a convention of representing the locus in terms of a reference panel of operationally distinguishable segments defined by hierarchical clustering. Using this reference set, we develop a pipeline that identifies copy number and allelic variation in the IGHV locus from whole-genome sequencing reads. Tests on simulated reads demonstrate that our approach is feasible and accurate for detecting the presence and absence of gene segments using reads as short as 70 bp. With reads 100 bp and longer, coverage depth can also be used to determine copy number. When applied to a family of European ancestry, our method finds new copy number variants and confirms existing variants.

Even so, quantitative approaches to cellular dynamics add to our understanding of cell biology, providing data-guided frameworks that allow us to develop better predictions about, and methods for, control over specific biological processes and system-wide cell behavior. In this paper, we describe an approach to optimizing the use of transcription factors (TFs) in the context of cellular reprogramming. We construct an approximate model for the natural evolution of a cell cycle synchronized population of human fibroblasts, based on data obtained by sampling the expression of 22,083 genes at several time points along the cell cycle. In order to arrive at a model of moderate complexity, we cluster gene expression based on the division of the genome into topologically associating domains (TADs) and then model the dynamics of the TAD expression levels. Based on this dynamical model and known bioinformatics, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and functions, we develop a methodology for identifying the top transcription factor candidates for a specific cellular reprogramming task. The approach used is based on a device commonly used in optimal control. Our data-guided methodology identifies a number of transcription factors previously validated for reprogramming and/or natural differentiation.

While the transcriptional control of anthocyanin biosynthesis is well understood, little is known about the factors regulating the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in flowers. Here, we characterize the Reduced Carotenoid Pigmentation 2 (RCP2) locus from two monkeyflower (Mimulus) species, the bumblebee-pollinated M. lewisii and hummingbird-pollinated M. verbenaceus. We show that loss-of-function mutations of RCP2 cause drastic down-regulation of the entire carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in these species. Through bulk segregant analysis and transgenic experiments, we have identified the causal gene underlying RCP2, encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein that is closely related to the Arabidopsis Reduced Chloroplast Coverage (REC) proteins. RCP2 appears to regulate carotenoid biosynthesis independently of RCP1, a previously identified R2R3-MYB master regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis. We show that RCP2 is required for chromoplast development and suggest that it most likely regulates the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes through chromoplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M. verbenaceus is just as amenable to chemical mutagenesis and in planta transformation as the more extensively studied M. lewisii, making these two species an excellent platform for comparative developmental genetics studies of two closely related species with dramatic phenotypic divergence.","['lauren.stanley@uconn.edu', 'yuan.colreeze@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/171249,biorxiv,2017,ae61e6ae-96b8-488f-9796-5f293f20fab4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/171249.full.pdf

Materials and Method  We used contextual autocomplete, a user interface that ranks concepts by their predicted probability, to help nurses enter data about a patient's reason for visiting the ED.  Predicted probabilities were calculated using a previously derived model based on triage vital signs and a brief free text note. We evaluated the percentage and quality of structured data captured using a prospective before-and-after study design.
Results A total of 279,231 patient encounters were analyzed. Structured data capture improved from 26.2% to 97.2% (p<0.0001). During the post-implementation period, presenting problems were more complete (3.35 vs 3.66; p=0.0004), as precise (3.59 vs. 3.74; p=0.1), and higher in overall quality (3.38 vs. 3.72; p=0.0002). Our system reduced the mean number of keystrokes required to document a presenting problem from 11.6 to 0.6 (p<0.0001), a 95% improvement.
Discussion  We have demonstrated a technique that captures structured data on nearly all patients. We estimate that our system reduces the number of man-hours required annually to type presenting problems at our institution from 92.5 hours to 4.8 hours.

To test this proposal, we investigated how the magnitude of short- and long-term structural priming effects change throughout the lifespan. Previous studies have suggested that perceptual and conceptual memory age differently, with only conceptual memory showing age-related decline. Therefore, by investigating how decreased performance in perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory tasks relate to decreased structural priming magnitude across the lifespan, we aim to elucidate how non-declarative memory supports two seemingly different components of structural priming. We find no change in short-term priming magnitude and performance on perceptual tasks, whereas both long-term priming and conceptual memory declined with age.

Cortical circuits implement optimal context integration,"Ramakrishnan Iyer,  View ORCID ProfileStefan Mihalas",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) predominantly respond to a patch of the visual input, their classical receptive field. These responses are modulated by the visual input in the surround [2]. This reflects the fact that features in natural scenes do not occur in isolation: lines, surfaces are generally continuous, and the surround provides context for the information in the classical receptive field. It is generally assumed that the information in the near surround is transmitted via lateral connections, between neurons in the same area [2]. A series of large scale efforts have recently described the relation between lateral connectivity and visual evoked responses and found like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons [16, 18]. Additionally, specific cell type connectivity for inhibitory neuron types has been described [11, 31]. Current normative models of cortical function relying on sparsity [27], saliency [4] predict functional inhibition between similarly tuned neurons. What computations are consistent with the observed structure of the lateral connections between the excitatory and diverse types of inhibitory neurons?

We combined natural scene statistics [24] and mouse V1 neuron responses [7] to compute the lateral connections and computations of individual neurons which optimally integrate information from the classical receptive field with that from the surround by directly implementing Bayes rule. This increases the accuracy of representation of a natural scene under noisy conditions. We show that this network has like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons, similar to the observed one [16, 18, 11], and has three types of inhibition: local normalization, surround inhibition and gating of inhibition from the surround - that can be attributed to three classes of inhibitory neurons. We hypothesize that this computation: optimal integration of contextual cues with a gate to ignore context when necessary is a general property of cortical circuits, and the rules constructed for mouse V1 generalize to other areas and species.",['stefanm@alleninstitute.org'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/158360,biorxiv,2017,53e799d3-c3ac-4108-a5da-f177759d12ca,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/158360.full.pdf

However, the huge computation of a large kernel matrix prevents it from using large amount of data. To this end, we proposed a flexible and scalable framework gkm-DNN to achieve feature representation and prediction from high-dimensional gkm-fvs using deep neural networks (DNN). We first implemented an efficient method to calculate the gkm-fv of a given sequence. We then adopted a DNN model with gkm-fvs as input to achieve a prediction task. Here, we took the transcription factor binding site prediction as an illustrative application. We applied gkm-DNN onto 467 small and 69 big human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets to demonstrate its performance and compared it with the state-of-the-art method gkm-SVM. We demonstrated that gkm-DNN can not only overcome the drawbacks of high dimensionality, colinearity and sparsity of gkm-fvs, but also make comparable overall performance and distinct better accuracy compared with gkm-SVM in much shorter time.

Callaghan,  View ORCID ProfileTimothy Keller,  View ORCID ProfileMartin I. Sereno,  View ORCID ProfileLori Holt",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But, it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation - acoustic frequency - might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically-estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically-mapped non-primary auditory cortex. The attentionally-driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in non-auditory areas. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored. Moreover, the single frequency bands that evoke the least activation and the frequency bands that elicit the least activation when attention is directed to them also correspond closely. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically-mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R1-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.","['f.dick@bbk.ac.uk', 'loriholt@cmu.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/26/142513,biorxiv,2017,9fa9f5a8-fe53-4155-a74d-fafe297b0327,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/26/142513.full.pdf
Monitoring large populations of locus coeruleus neurons reveals the non-global nature of the norepinephrine neuromodulatory system," View ORCID ProfileNelson K Totah, Ricardo M Neves, Stefano Panzeri, Nikos K Logothetis, Oxana Eschenko",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Understanding the forebrain neuromodulation by the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is fundamental for cognitive and systems neuroscience. The diffuse projections of individual LC neurons and presumably their synchronous spiking have long been perceived as features of the global nature of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Yet, the commonly referenced ""synchrony"" underlying global neuromodulation, has never been assessed in a large population, nor has it been related to projection target specificity. Here, we recorded up to 52 single units simultaneously (3164 unit pairs in total) in rat LC and characterized projections by stimulating 15 forebrain sites. Spike count correlations were surprisingly low and only 13% of pairwise spike trains had synchronized spontaneous discharge. Notably, even noxious sensory stimulation did not activate the population, only evoking synchronized responses in 1.6% of units on each trial. We also identified novel infra-slow (0.01-1 Hz) fluctuations of LC unit spiking that were asynchronous across the population. A minority, synchronized possibly by gap junctions, has restricted (non-global) forebrain projection patterns. Finally, we characterized two types of LC single units differing by waveform shape, propensity for synchronization, and interactions with cortex. These cell types formed finely-structured ensembles.

Statistical Mechanics Of Phase Space Partitioning In Large-Scale Spiking Neuron Circuits,"Maximilian Puelma Touzel, Fred Wolf",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Synaptic interactions structure the phase space of the dynamics of neural circuits and constrain neural computation. Understanding how requires methods that handle those discrete interactions, yet few exist. Recently, it was discovered that even random networks exhibit dynamics that partitions the phase space into numerous attractor basins. Here we utilize this phenomenon to develop theory for the geometry of phase space partitioning in spiking neural circuits. We find basin boundaries structuring the phase space are pre-images of spike-time collision events. Formulating a statistical theory of spike-time collision events, we derive expressions for the rate of divergence of neighboring basins and for their size distribution. This theory reveals that the typical basin diameter grows with inhibitory coupling strength and shrinks with the rate of spike events. Our study provides an analytical and generalizable approach for dissecting how connectivity, coupling strength, single neuron dynamics and population activity shape the phase space geometry of spiking circuits.",['puelma@lpt.ens.fr'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/132993,biorxiv,2017,616426a2-0577-4e1c-bf01-a481ee9239f9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/132993.full.pdf

"Calming Meditation Increases Altruism, Decreases Parochialism",Karl Frost,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"It has been proposed that cultivating calm will increase altruism and decrease parochialism, where altruism is defined as self-sacrifice in support of others, regardless of group affiliation or identity, and parochialism is defined as prosocial self-sacrifice restricted to fellow members of a group. Such could be the case with a calming meditation practice. An alternate hypothesis, coming from the study of ritual, proposes that shared practices lead to bonding, increasing parochialism, but not altruism generally. These contradictory hypotheses of the potential effects of shared cultural practices of calming meditation were explored via a formal behavioral experiment using a simple treatment and control format with a short, facilitated breath awareness practice known to produce calm. Altruism and parochialism were measured through anonymous play in Public Goods games performed with both in-group and out-group individuals. The sum of contributions of the two plays gave a measure of altruism, while the difference between the two gave a measure of parochialism. The analysis of the results using Bayesian AICc model comparison methods supports the first hypothesis that calming practices reduces parochialism and increases altruism.

Our goal was to develop a 3-phase variant of the hidden goal water task to assess old and new spatial memories acquired in the same context using various measures of spatial learning in C57BL/6 mice.  In the first phase, mice were pre-trained to an initially hidden location.  The second phase consisted of a massed training session to a new location in the same apparatus and context. The final phase consisted of a competition test between the original and new platform locations. AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a novel transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer disease (AD), were also used as an independent variable to validate this 3-phase variant of MWT. The results of the present study showed that C57 mice acquired and retained both the old and new location representations; however, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice retained a recently acquired spatial memory but did not remember the old location acquired in the same apparatus and context. The results showed that C57 mice can show precise place learning and memory with the right amount of training and acquire and retain multiple spatial memory locations in the same environment whereas this ability was impaired in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. In the visible platform test, however, all groups of mice showed normal sensorimotor ability and motivation. These findings indicate that this new version of the MWT provides a robust way for assessment of old and new memories in mice. This paradigm could also be exploited to assess manipulations of neural circuits implicated in learning and memory processes as well as for research investigating human brain diseases.","['mohajerani@uleth.ca', 'r.mcdonald@uleth.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/16/177105,biorxiv,2017,15dc1ae7-17fd-4940-8bdb-80e9e3f76a99,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/16/177105.full.pdf

Here, we test this by asking if a learned spatial prior generalizes from a sensorimotor estimation task to a two-alternative-forced choice (2-Afc) perceptual comparison task. A model and simulation-based analysis revealed that while subjects learn the experimentally-imposed prior distribution in the sensorimotor estimation task, measured priors are consistently broader than expected in the 2-Afc task.

Yet, how and when cells temporally integrate signals from a morphogen remains unclear.  Here, we use optogenetic manipulation to switch off Bicoid-dependent transcription in the early Drosophila embryo with high temporal resolution, allowing time-specific and reversible manipulation of morphogen signalling.  We find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior. Such anterior susceptibility correlates with high reliance of anterior gap gene expression on Bicoid. Therefore, cell fates exposed to higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a previously unknown aspect of morphogen decoding.",['dbsste@nus.edu.sg'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/110841,biorxiv,2017,3607a78f-1a4d-4b26-bd69-41f71e3dbe4b,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/110841.full.pdf

Population-Scale Sequencing Data Enables Precise Estimates of Y-STR Mutation Rates,"Thomas Willems, Melissa Gymrek, G. David Poznik, Chris Tyler-Smith, The 1000 Genomes Project Chromosome Y Group, Yaniv Erlich",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are mutation-prone loci that span nearly 1% of the human genome. Previous studies have estimated the mutation rates of highly polymorphic STRs using capillary electrophoresis and pedigree-based designs. While this work has provided insights into the mutational dynamics of highly mutable STRs, the mutation rates of most others remain unknown. Here, we harnessed whole-genome sequencing data to estimate the mutation rates of Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) with 2-6 base pair repeat units that are accessible to Illumina sequencing. We genotyped 4,500 Y-STRs using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. Next, we developed MUTEA, an algorithm that infers STR mutation rates from population-scale data using a high-resolution SNP-based phylogeny. After extensive intrinsic and extrinsic validations, we harnessed MUTEA to derive mutation rate estimates for 702 polymorphic STRs by tracing each locus over 222,000 meioses, resulting in the largest collection of Y-STR mutation rates to date.

These predictions indicate that the load of de novo STR mutations is at least 75 mutations per generation, rivaling the load of all other known variant types.

Since the advent of high-throughput data acquisition technologies in fields such as genomics, metabolomics, and neuroscience, the automated inference and reconstruction of such interaction networks directly from large sets of activation data, commonly known as reverse-engineering, has become a routine procedure. Whereas early attempts at network reverse-engineering focused predominantly on producing maps of system architectures with minimal predictive modeling, reconstructions now play instrumental roles in answering questions about the statistics and dynamics of the underlying systems they represent. Many of these predictions have clinical relevance, suggesting novel paradigms for drug discovery and disease treatment. While other reviews focus predominantly on the details and effectiveness of individual network inference algorithms, here we examine the emerging field as a whole. We first summarize several key application areas in which inferred networks have made successful predictions. We then outline the two major classes of reverse-engineering methodologies, emphasizing that the type of prediction that one aims to make dictates the algorithms one should employ.

However, a full understanding of gene regulation in any given cellular and environmental context combination is still missing. This is partly because analyzing tissue/environment-specific gene expression generally implies screening a large number of cellular conditions and samples, without prior knowledge of which conditions are most informative (e.g. some cell types may not respond to certain treatments). To circumvent these challenges, we have established a new two-step high-throughput and cost-effective RNA-seq approach: the first step consists of gene expression screening of a large number of conditions, while the second step focuses on deep sequencing of the most relevant conditions (e.g. largest number of differentially expressed genes). This study design allows for a fast and economical screen in step one, with a more profitable allocation of resources for the deep sequencing of re-pooled libraries in step two. We have applied this approach to study the response to 26 treatments in three lymphoblastoid cell line samples and we show that it is applicable for other high-throughput transcriptome profiling requiring iterative refinement or screening.","['uca@wayne.edu', 'rpique@wayne.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/09/018416,biorxiv,2015,83cc230b-e299-4986-a01e-bff7df20b355,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/09/018416.full.pdf

We employ a marker of auditory learning and putative synaptic plasticity - the mismatch negativity - in a roving auditory oddball paradigm. Using recent advances in Bayesian modelling of group effects in dynamic causal modelling, we fit biophysically plausible network models of the auditory processing hierarchy to whole-scalp evoked response potential recordings. This allowed us to identify the regionally specific effects of ketamine in a distributed network of interacting cortical sources. Under placebo, our analysis replicated previous findings regarding the effects of stimulus repetition and deviance on connectivity within the auditory hierarchy. Crucially, we show that the effect of ketamine is best explained as a selective change in intrinsic inhibition, with a pronounced ketamine-induced reduction of inhibitory interneuron connectivity in frontal sources. These results are consistent with findings from invasive recordings in animal models exposed to NMDAR blockers, and provide evidence that inhibitory-interneuron specific NMDAR dysfunction may be sufficient to explain electrophysiological abnormalities of sensory learning induced by ketamine in human subjects.",['r.rosch@ucl.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/133371,biorxiv,2017,a5dc7abc-37f8-4dc5-9461-b7d93add1f71,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/133371.full.pdf
Bayesian Efficient Coding,"Il Memming Park, Jonathan W. Pillow",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brain's ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. Here we bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems. We examine Bayesian efficient codes for linear receptive fields and nonlinear input-output functions, and show that our theory invites reinterpretation of Laughlin's seminal analysis of efficient coding in the blowfly visual system.","['memming.park@stonybrook.edu', 'pillow@princeton.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/25/178418,biorxiv,2017,96c40c04-5bff-4ee3-8a99-c3dd344af066,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/25/178418.full.pdf

This natural tendency of memory replay can be induced by external cueing, known as targeted memory reactivation. Here, we analyzed data from a published study (van Dongen, Takashima, et al. 2012), where auditory cues reactivated learned visual object-location memories during SWS. Memory replay during sleep presumably involves a shift in connectivity across the brain. Therefore, we characterized the effects of memory reactivation on brain network connectivity using graph-theory. We found that cue presentation during SWS introduced increased network integration of the occipital cortex, a visual region that was also active during the object retrieval task. Importantly, enhanced network integration of the occipital cortex showed a behavioural benefit and predicted overnight memory stabilization. Furthermore, occipital cortex displayed enhanced connectivity with mnemonic regions, namely the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex during cue versus control sound presentation. Finally, network integration of early occipital cortex during cueing in SWS was related to increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, a region involved in coding for spatial associative information, at the post-sleep test.

To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting noncoding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory ""grammar"" to improve predictions.

Running Promotes Spatial Bias Independently Of Adult Neurogenesis," View ORCID ProfileJason Scott Snyder, Shaina P Cahill, Paul W Frankland",Now published in Hippocampus. 2017,"Different memory systems offer distinct advantages to navigational behavior. The hippocampus forms complex associations between environmental stimuli, enabling flexible navigation through space. In contrast, the dorsal striatum associates discrete cues and favorable behavioral responses, enabling habit-like, automated navigation. While these two systems often complement one another, there are instances where striatal-dependent responses (e.g. approach a cue) conflict with hippocampal representations of spatial goals. In conflict situations, preference for spatial vs. response strategies varies across individuals and depends on previous experience, plasticity and the integrity of these two memory systems. Here, we investigated the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise on mouse search strategies in a water maze task that can be solved with either a hippocampal-dependent place strategy or a striatal-dependent cue-response strategy. We predicted that inhibiting adult neurogenesis would impair hippocampal function and shift behavior towards striatal-dependent cue responses. However, blocking neurogenesis in a transgenic nestin-TK mouse did not affect strategy choice. We then investigated whether a pro-neurogenic stimulus, running, would bias mice towards hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies. While running indeed promoted spatial strategies, it did so even when neurogenesis was inhibited in nestin-TK mice. These findings indicate that exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis are not always required for enhanced cognitive function. Furthermore, our data identify exercise as a potentially useful strategy for promoting flexible, cognitive forms of memory in habit-related disorders that are characterized by excessive responding to discrete cues.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/125260,biorxiv,2017,70a1e275-0369-4a1d-81f9-07ff783d9356,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/125260.full.pdf

Capturing the diversity of biological tuning curves using generative adversarial networks,"Takafumi Arakaki, Gregory Barello, Yashar Ahmadian",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g. the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.","['tarakaki@uoregon.edu', 'gbarello@uoregon.edu', 'yashar@uoregon.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24/167916,biorxiv,2017,6f73a0c2-4f2e-45d8-bde8-5c99a38cffbf,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24/167916.full.pdf

"Sharing of Very Short IBD Segments between Humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans","Gundula Povysil, Sepp Hochreiter",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"We analyze the sharing of very short identity by descent (IBD) segments between humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans to gain new insights into their demographic history. Short IBD segments convey information about events far back in time because the shorter IBD segments are, the older they are assumed to be. The identification of short IBD segments becomes possible through next generation sequencing (NGS), which offers high variant density and reports variants of all frequencies. However, only recently HapFABIA has been proposed as the first method for detecting very short IBD segments in NGS data. HapFABIA utilizes rare variants to identify IBD segments with a low false discovery rate.

We applied HapFABIA to the 1000 Genomes Project whole genome sequencing data to identify IBD segments that are shared within and between populations. Many IBD segments have to be old since they are shared with Neandertals or Denisovans, which explains their shorter lengths compared to segments that are not shared with these ancient genomes. The Denisova genome most prominently matches IBD segments that are shared by Asians. Many of these segments were found exclusively in Asians and they are longer than segments shared between other continental populations and the Denisova genome. Therefore, we could confirm an introgression from Deniosvans into ancestors of Asians after their migration out of Africa. While Neandertal-matching IBD segments are most often shared by Asians, Europeans share a considerably higher percentage of IBD segments with Neandertals compared to other populations, too. Again, many of these Neandertal-matching IBD segments are found exclusively in Asians, whereas Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Europeans are often found in other populations, too. Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Asians or Europeans are longer than those observed in Africans. These IBD segments hint at a gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans after they left Africa. Interestingly, many Neandertal- and/or Denisova-matching IBD segments are predominantly observed in Africans - some of them even exclusively. IBD segments shared between Africans and Neandertals or Denisovans are strikingly short, therefore we assume that they are very old. Consequently, we conclude that DNA regions from ancestors of humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans have survived in Africans. As expected, IBD segments on chromosome X are on average longer than IBD segments on the autosomes. Neandertal-matching IBD segments on chromosome X confirm gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans outside Africa that was already found on the autosomes.

We propose a way for compensating the omission of CSF by decreasing the skull conductivity of the 3-S model, and study the robustness of the 4-C and 3-S models to errors in skull conductivity.
We generated dense boundary meshes using MRI datasets and automated SimNIBS pipeline. Then, we built a dense 4-C reference model using Galerkin BEM, and 4-C and 3-S test models using coarser meshes and both Galerkin and collocation BEMs. We compared field topographies of cortical sources, applying various skull conductivities and fitting conductivities that minimized the relative error in 4-C and 3-S models. When the CSF was left out from the EEG model, our compensated, unbiased approach improved the accuracy of the 3-S model considerably compared to the conventional approach, where CSF is neglected without any compensation (mean relative error < 20% vs. > 40%). The error due to the omission of CSF was of the same order in MEG and compensated EEG. EEG has, however, large overall error due to uncertain skull conductivity.
Our results show that a realistic 4-C MEG/EEG model can be implemented using standard tools and basic BEM, without excessive workload or computational burden. If the CSF is omitted, compensated skull conductivity should be used in EEG.","['matti.stenroos@aalto.fi', 'nummenma@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/037788,biorxiv,2016,2194c95f-3d2b-474b-b0c1-bb1e8d3882b3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/037788.full.pdf
Dynamic cortical representations of perceptual filling-in for missing acoustic rhythm,"Francisco Cervantes Constantino,  View ORCID ProfileJonathan Z Simon",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In the phenomenon of perceptual filling-in, missing sensory information can be reconstructed via interpolation from adjacent contextual cues by what is necessarily an endogenous, not yet well understood, neural process. In this investigation, sound stimuli were chosen to allow observation of fixed cortical oscillations driven by contextual (but missing) sensory input, thus entirely reflecting endogenous neural activity. The stimulus employed was a 5 Hz frequency-modulated tone, with brief masker probes (noise bursts) occasionally added. For half the probes, the rhythmic frequency modulation was moreover removed. Listeners reported whether the tone masked by each probe was perceived as being rhythmic or not. Time-frequency analysis of neural responses obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows that for maskers without the underlying acoustic rhythm, trials where rhythm was nonetheless perceived show higher evoked sustained rhythmic power than trials for which no rhythm was reported. The results support a model in which perceptual filling-in is aided by differential co-modulations of cortical activity at rates directly relevant to human speech communication. We propose that the presence of rhythmically-modulated neural dynamics predicts the subjective experience of a rhythmically modulated sound in real time, even when the perceptual experience is not supported by corresponding sensory data.",['jzsimon@umd.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/165332,biorxiv,2017,ea01118c-903f-4425-8abf-2dc5e3117486,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/165332.full.pdf

Microdeletions involving the region downstream the gene have been also associated to speech and cognitive deficits. We recently described a girl harbouring a complex chromosomal rearrangement with one breakpoint downstream the gene that might affect her speech and cognitive abilities via physical separation of distant regulatory DNA elements. In this study, we have used highly efficient targeted chromosomal deletions induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to demonstrate the functionality of two enhancers, FOXP2-Eproximal and FOXP2-Edistal, located in the intergenic region between FOXP2 and its adjacent MDFIC gene. Deletion of any of these two functional enhancers in the neuroblastomic cell line SK-N-MC downregulates FOXP2 and decreases FOXP2 protein levels, conversely it upregulates MDFIC and increases MDFIC protein levels. This suggests that both regulatory elements may be shared between FOXP2 and MDFIC.

Sequence properties underlying gene regulatory enhancers are conserved across mammals,"Ling Chen, Alexandra E Fish, John Anthony Capra",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Gene expression patterns and transcription factor DNA binding preferences are largely conserved across mammals; however, there is substantial turnover in active regulatory enhancers between closely related species. We investigated this seeming contradiction by quantifying the conservation of sequence patterns underlying histone-mark defined enhancers across six diverse mammalian species (human, macaque, mouse, dog, cow, and opossum). In each species, we found that machine-learning classifiers based on short DNA sequence patterns could accurately identify many adult liver and developing limb enhancers. We applied these classifiers across species and found that classifiers trained in different species performed nearly as well as classifiers trained on the target species, indicating that the underlying sequence properties predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. We also observed similar cross-species conservation in classifiers trained on human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic reporter assays, and these classifiers learned predictive sequence properties similar to the classifiers trained on histone-mark defined enhancers. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, which supports the biological relevance of the learned features.

Intraventricular injection of NPC yielded an anatomical symmetrical glia (human astrocyte and oligodendrocyte) repopulation of the mouse brain. The human glia were observed in periventricular areas, white matter tracts, the olfactory bulb and brain stem. HIV-1 infection of these dual humanized mice led to meningeal and perivascular human leukocyte infiltration into brain. The species-specific viral-neuroimmune interactions in the infected animals were identified by deep RNA sequencing. In the corpus callosum and hippocampus overlapping human-specific transcriptional alterations were seen for interferon type 1 and 2 signaling pathways (STAT1, 2, IRF9, ISG15, IFI6) and a range of host antiviral responses (MX1, OAS1, RSAD2, BST2, SAMHD1) in infected animals. Glial cytoskeleton reorganization, oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin ensheathment (MBP, MOBP, PLP1, MAG and ZNF488) were downregulated. The data sets were confirmed by real-time PCR.

Jesse Shapiro",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Cyanobacterial blooms occur in lakes worldwide, producing toxins that pose a serious public health threat. Eutrophication caused by human activities and warmer temperatures both contribute to blooms, but it is still difficult to predict precisely when and where blooms will occur. One reason that prediction is so difficult is that blooms can be caused by different species or genera of cyanobacteria, which may interact with other bacteria and respond to a variety of environmental cues. Here we used a deep 16S amplicon sequencing approach to profile the bacterial community in eutrophic Lake Champlain over time, to characterize the composition and repeatability of cyanobacterial blooms, and to determine the potential for blooms to be predicted based on time-course sequence data. Our analysis, based on 135 samples between 2006 and 2013, spans multiple bloom events. We found that bloom events significantly alter the bacterial community without reducing overall diversity, suggesting that a distinct microbial community -- including non-cyanobacteria -- prospers during the bloom. We also observed that the community changes cyclically over the course of a year, with a repeatable pattern from year to year. This suggests that, in principle, bloom events are predictable. We used probabilistic assemblages of OTUs to characterize the bloom-associated community, and to classify samples into bloom or non-bloom categories, achieving up to 92% classification accuracy (86% after excluding cyanobacterial sequences). Finally, using symbolic regression, we were able to predict the start date of a bloom with 78-92% accuracy (depending on the data used for model training), and found that sequence data was a better predictor than environmental variables.","['jesse.shapiro@umontreal.ca', 'nicolas.tromas@umontreal.ca.']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/16/058289,biorxiv,2017,f7ee77de-4b36-47fb-9efe-e7e926a2b269,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/16/058289.full.pdf

The rapid evolution of alternative splicing in plants,"Zhihao Ling, Thomas Brockmoeller, Ian T. Baldwin, Shuqing Xu",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is prevalent among all plants and is involved in many interactions with environmental stresses. However, the evolutionary patterns and underlying mechanisms of AS in plants remain unclear. By analyzing the transcriptomes of six plant species, we revealed that AS diverged rapidly among closely related species, largely due to the gains and losses of AS events among orthologous genes. Furthermore, AS that generates transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTC), although only representing a small fraction of the total AS, are more conserved than those that generate non-PTC containing transcripts, suggesting that AS coupled with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) might play an important role in regulating mRNA levels post-transcriptionally. With a machine learning approach we analyzed the key determinants of AS to understand the mechanisms underlying its rapid divergence. Among the studied species, the presence/absence of alternative splicing site (SS) within the junction, the distance between the authentic SS and the nearest alternative SS, the size of exon-exon junctions were the major determinants for both alternative donor site and acceptor site, suggesting a relatively conserved AS mechanism. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that variations of the identified AS determinants, mostly are located in introns, significantly contributed to the AS turnover among closely related species in both Solanaceae and Brassicaceae taxa. These new mechanistic insights into the evolution of AS in plants highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in mediating plant-environment interactions.","['zling@ice.mpg.de', 'tbrockmoeller@ice.mpg.de', 'baldwin@ice.mpg.de', 'sxu@ice.mpg', 'sxu@ice.mpg.de', 'sxu@ice.mpg.de']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/13/107938,biorxiv,2017,8531bf9a-b282-437b-b328-c45a7d3849a6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/13/107938.full.pdf

SELEX selects binders through an iterative process that, starting from a  pool of random ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine binding.

This behavioral plasticity arises from prolonged activity differences in a circuit that continuously signals O2 levels. A sustained change in the activity of O2 sensing neurons reprograms the properties of their post-synaptic partners, the RMG hub interneurons. RMG is gap-junctionally coupled to the ASK and ADL pheromone sensors that respectively drive pheromone attraction and repulsion. Prior O2 experience has opposite effects on the pheromone responsiveness of these neurons. These circuit changes provide a physiological correlate of altered pheromone valence.

While computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new challenges. In particular, traditional analytical workflows struggle to align subpopulations that are present across datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative analysis. Here, we introduce a new computational strategy for scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to identify shared subpopulations between datasets as part of our R toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning scRNA-seq datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced across two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets independently. We anticipate that these methods will serve not only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but also to facilitate general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.

Coupled with targeted RNA sequencing, Tradict may therefore enable simultaneous transcriptome-wide screening and mechanistic investigation at large scales.","['surojitbiswas@g.harvard.edu', 'Philip.Wigge@slcu.cam.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/11/060111,biorxiv,2016,f38ad1d1-f274-49f7-8207-af4a7248babe,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/11/060111.full.pdf

Bajic",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In mammalian cells, transcribed enhancers (TrEn) play important roles in the initiation of gene expression and maintenance of gene expression levels in spatiotemporal manner. One of the most challenging questions in biology today is how the genomic characteristics of enhancers relate to enhancer activities. This is particularly critical, as several recent studies have linked enhancer sequence motifs to specific functional roles. To date, only a limited number of enhancer sequence characteristics have been investigated, leaving space for exploring the enhancers genomic code in a more systematic way. To address this problem, we developed a novel computational method, TELS, aimed at identifying predictive cell type/tissue specific motif signatures. We used TELS to compile a comprehensive catalog of motif signatures for all known TrEn identified by the FANTOM5 consortium across 112 human primary cells and tissues. Our results confirm that distinct cell type/tissue specific motif signatures characterize TrEn. These signatures allow discriminating successfully a) TrEn from random controls, proxy of non-enhancer activity, and b) cell type/tissue specific TrEn from enhancers expressed and transcribed in different cell types/tissues.

Functional connectivity models for decoding of spatial representations from hippocampal CA1 recordings,"Lorenzo Posani, Simona Cocco, Karel Jezek, Remi Monasson",Now published in Journal of Computational Neuroscience. 2017,"Hippocampus stores spatial representations, or maps, which are recalled each time a subject is placed in the corresponding environment. Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in CA3 of hippocampus, whereas in the CA1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the moment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution.  Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based decoder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in CA1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation . 
We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer (> 1 min.) periods.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/19/073759,biorxiv,2017,003d6df1-384a-4e61-8931-f6a5fa637d54,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/19/073759.full.pdf

Consistent with this hypothesis, we discovered that drawings contain the features most important for recognizing objects in photographs, and that learning to make more recognizable drawings of objects generalizes to enhanced recognition of those objects.

Bridging Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning on Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandits,"George Velentzas, Costas Tzafestas,  View ORCID ProfileMehdi Khamassi",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Fast adaptation to changes in the environment requires both natural and artificial agents to be able to dynamically tune an exploration-exploitation trade-off during learning. This trade-off usually determines a fixed proportion of exploitative choices (i.e. choice of the action that subjectively appears as best at a given moment) relative to exploratory choices (i.e. testing other actions that now appear worst but may turn out promising later). The problem of finding an efficient exploration-exploitation trade-off has been well studied both in the Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience fields. Rather than using a fixed proportion, non-stationary multi-armed bandit methods in the former have proven that principles such as exploring actions that have not been tested for a long time can lead to performance closer to optimal - bounded regret. In parallel, researches in the latter have investigated solutions such as progressively increasing exploita- tion in response to improvements of performance, transiently increasing exploration in response to drops in average performance, or attributing exploration bonuses specifically to actions associated with high uncertainty in order to gain information when performing these actions. In this work, we first try to bridge some of these different methods from the two research fields by rewriting their decision process with a common formalism. We then show numerical simulations of a hybrid algorithm combining bio-inspired meta-learning, kalman filter and exploration bonuses compared to several state-of-the-art alternatives on a set of non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit tasks.

T-SNE visualization of large-scale neural recordings.,"George Dimitriadis, Joana Neto, Adam Kampff",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Electrophysiology is entering the era of 'Big Data'. Multiple probes, each with hundreds to thousands of individual electrodes, are now capable of simultaneously recording from many brain regions. The major challenge confronting these new technologies is transforming the raw data into physiologically meaningful signals, i.e. single unit spikes. Sorting the spike events of individual neurons from a spatiotemporally dense sampling of the extracellular electric field is a problem that has attracted much attention (Rey 2015, Rossant 2016), but is still far from solved. Current methods still rely on human input and thus become unfeasible as the size of the data sets grow exponentially.
Here we introduce the t-student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) dimensionality reduction method (Van der Maaten 2008) as a visualization tool in the spike sorting process. T-sne embeds the n-dimensional extracellular spikes (n = number of features by which each spike is decomposed) into a low (usually two) dimensional space. We show that such embeddings, even starting from different feature spaces, form obvious clusters of spikes that can be easily visualized and manually delineated with a high degree of precision. We propose that these clusters represent single units and test this assertion by applying our algorithm on labeled data sets both from hybrid (Rossant 2016) and paired juxtacellular/extracellular recordings (Neto 2016). We have released a graphical user interface (gui) written in python as a tool for the manual clustering of the t-sne embedded spikes and as a tool for an informed overview and fast manual curation of results from other clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the generated visualizations offer evidence in favor of the use of probes with higher density and smaller electrodes. They also graphically demonstrate the diverse nature of the sorting problem when spikes are recorded with different methods and arise from regions with different background spiking statistics.",['g.dimitriadis@ucl.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/14/087395,biorxiv,2016,c2e53529-915e-49f0-afef-909620d83b35,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/14/087395.full.pdf

The impact of comorbidity of intellectual disability on estimates of autism prevalence among children enrolled in US special education,"Andrew Polyak, Richard M Kubina, Santhosh Girirajan",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"Objectives: While recent studies suggest a converging role for genetic factors towards risk for nosologically distinct disorders including autism, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy, current estimates of autism prevalence fail to take into account the impact of comorbidity of these neurodevelopmental disorders on autism diagnosis.  We aimed to assess the effect of potential comorbidity of ID on the diagnosis and prevalence of autism by analyzing 11 years of special education enrollment data.

Design: Population study of autism using the United States special education enrollment data from years 2000-2010.
 
Setting: US special education.

Participants: We analyzed 11 years (2000 to 2010) of longitudinal data on approximately 6.2 million children per year from special education enrollment.

Results: We found a 331% increase in the prevalence of autism from 2000 to 2010 within special education, potentially due to a diagnostic recategorization from frequently comorbid features like ID.  In fact, the decrease in ID prevalence equaled an average of 64.2% of the increase of autism prevalence for children aged 3-18 years.  The proportion of ID cases potentially undergoing recategorization to autism was higher (p=0.007) among older children (75%) than younger children (48%).  Some US states showed significant negative correlations between the prevalence of autism compared to that of ID while others did not, suggesting differences in state-specific health policy to be a major factor in categorizing autism. 

Conclusions:  Our results suggest that current ascertainment practices are based on a single facet of autism-specific clinical features and do not consider associated comorbidities that may confound diagnosis.  Longitudinal studies with detailed phenotyping and deep molecular genetic analyses are necessary to completely understand the cause of this complex disorder.  Future studies of autism prevalence should also take these factors into account.",['sxg47@psu.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/17/011528,biorxiv,2014,2a7decb6-d4b2-4ace-a2d6-0165710f9bb3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/17/011528.full.pdf

Elevation of linkage disequilibrium above neutral expectations in ancestral and derived populations of Drosophila melanogaster,"Nandita R. Garud, Dmitri A. Petrov",Now published in Genetics. 2015,"The extent to which selection and demography impact patterns of genetic diversity in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster is yet to be fully understood. We previously observed that the pattern of LD at scales of ~10 kb in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), consisting of 145 inbred strains from Raleigh, North Carolina, measured both between pairs of sites and as haplotype homozygosity, is elevated above neutral demographic expectations. Further, we demonstrated that signatures of strong and recent soft sweeps are abundant. However, the extent to which this pattern is specific to this derived and admixed population is unknown. Neither is it clear whether such a pattern may have arisen as a consequence of the extensive inbreeding performed to generate the DGRP data. Here we analyze > 100 fully sequenced strains from Zambia, an ancestral population to the Raleigh population, that has experienced little to no admixture and was generated by sequencing haploid embryos rather than inbred strains. This data set allows us to determine whether patterns of elevated LD and signatures of abundant soft sweeps are generic to multiple populations of D. melanogaster or whether they are generated either by inbreeding, bottlenecks or admixture in the DGRP dataset. We find an elevation in long-range LD and haplotype homozygosity in the Zambian dataset, confirming the result from the DGRP data set. This elevation in LD and haplotype structure remains even after controlling for many sources of LD in the data including genomic inversions, admixture, population substructure, close relatedness of individual strains, and recombination rate variation. Furthermore, signatures of partial soft sweeps similar to those found in the DGRP are common in Zambia. These results suggest that while the selective forces and sources of adaptive mutations may differ in Zambia and Raleigh, elevated long-range LD and signatures of soft sweeps are generic in D. melanogaster.","['ngarud@stanford.edu', 'dpetrov@stanford.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/27/029942,biorxiv,2015,dab426c8-7e51-41ed-81d8-ba22e73ce94f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/27/029942.full.pdf

Encoding And Decoding Dynamic Sensory Signals With Recurrent Neural Networks: An Application Of Conceptors To Birdsongs,"Richard Gast, Patrick Faion, Kai Standvoss, Andrea Suckro, Brian Lewis, Gordon Pipa",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In a constantly changing environment the brain has to make sense of dynamic patterns of sensory input. These patterns can refer to stimuli with a complex and hierarchical structure which has to be inferred from the neural activity of sensory areas in the brain. Such areas were found to be locally recurrently structured as well as hierarchically organized within a given sensory domain. While there is a great body of work identifying neural representations of various sensory stimuli at different hierarchical levels, less is known about the nature of these representations. In this work, we propose a model that describes a way to encode and decode sensory stimuli based on the activity patterns of multiple, recurrently connected neural populations with different receptive fields. We demonstrate the ability of our model to learn and recognize complex, dynamic stimuli using birdsongs as exemplary data. These birdsongs can be described by a 2-level hierarchical structure, i.e. as sequences of syllables. Our model matches this hierarchy by learning single syllables on a first level and sequences of these syllables on a top level. Model performance on recognition tasks is investigated for an increasing number of syllables or songs to recognize and compared to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

Inferring past effective population size from distributions of coalescent-times,"Lucie Gattepaille, Mattias Jakobsson",Now published in Genetics. 2015,"Inferring and understanding changes in effective population size over time is a major challenge for population genetics. Here we investigate some theoretical properties of random mating populations with varying size over time. In particular, we present an exact method to compute the population size as a function of time using the distributions of coalescent-times of samples of any size. This result reduces the problem of population size inference to a problem of estimating coalescent-time distributions. Using tree inference algorithms and genetic data, we can investigate the effects of a range of conditions associated with real data, for instance finite number of loci, sample size, mutation rate and presence of cryptic recombination. We show that our method requires at least a modest number of loci (10,000 or more) and that increasing the sample size from 2 to 10 greatly improves the inference whereas further increase in sample size only results in a modest improvement, even under as scenario of exponential growth. We also show that small amounts of recombination can lead to biased population size reconstruction when unaccounted for. The approach can handle large sample sizes and the computations are fast.

Extracting a Biologically Relevant Latent Space from Cancer Transcriptomes with Variational Autoencoders," View ORCID ProfileGregory P. Way,  View ORCID ProfileCasey S. Greene",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach.

We propose standardizing the formulation of the DNM and implementing it in software that takes static grayscale images as inputs and produces firing-rate responses as outputs.

This systematic approach identifies novel falsifiable predictions of the DNM. We show how the model simultaneously satisfies the conflicting desiderata of flexibility and falsifiability. Our key idea is that, while adjustable parameters are needed to accommodate the diversity across neurons, they must be fixed for a given individual neuron.

Changes in global physicochemical modes over time are thought to be a consistent feature of this relationship between Earth and life, as life is thought to have been optimizing protein functions for the entirety of its ~3.8 billion years of history on Earth. Organismal survival depends on how well critical genetic and metabolic components can adapt to their environments, reflecting an ability to optimize efficiently to changing conditions. The geologic record provides an array of biologically independent indicators of macroscale atmospheric and oceanic composition, but provides little in the way of the exact behavior of the molecular components that influenced the compositions of these reservoirs. By reconstructing sequences of proteins that might have been present in ancient organisms, we can identify a subset of possible sequences that may have been optimized to these ancient environmental conditions. How can extant life be used to reconstruct ancestral phenotypes? Configurations of ancient sequences can be inferred from the diversity of extant sequences, and then resurrected in the lab to ascertain their biochemical attributes. One way to augment sequence-based, single-gene methods to obtain a richer and more reliable picture of the deep past, is to resurrect inferred ancestral protein sequences in living organisms, where their phenotypes can be exposed in a complex molecular-systems context, and to then link consequences of those phenotypes to biosignatures that were preserved in the independent historical repository of the geological record. As a first-step beyond single molecule reconstruction to the study of functional molecular systems, we present here the ancestral sequence reconstruction of the beta-carbonic anhydrase protein.

A mixture of sparse coding models explaining properties of face neurons related to holistic and parts-based processing," View ORCID ProfileHaruo Hosoya, Aapo Hyvärinen",Now published in PLOS Computational Biology. 2017,"Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system.  However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system.  Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex.  We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis.  The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts.  Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input.  We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex.  Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009).  These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli.  Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.",['hosoya@atr.jp'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/25/086637,biorxiv,2017,63732a0b-fd4f-4718-b75b-0c556bba2c63,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/25/086637.full.pdf

We applied our method to a heterosexual transmission pair showing a complex paraphyletic-polyphyletic donor-recipient phylogenetic topology. We found evidence identifying the donor that was consistent with the known facts of the case (Bayes factor >20). We also found that while the evidence for ongoing transmission between the pair was as good or better than the singular transmission event model, it was only viable when the rate of ongoing transmission was implausibly high (~1/day). We concluded that the singular transmission model, which was able to estimate the diversity of the founding population (mean 7% substitutions/site), was more biologically plausible. Our study provides a formal inference framework to investigate HIV-1 direction, diversity, and frequency of transmission. The ability to measure the diversity of founding populations in both simple and complex transmission situations is essential to understanding the relationship between the phylogeny and epidemiology of HIV-1 as well as in efforts developing new prevention technologies.",['tkl@lanl.gov'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/24/071050,biorxiv,2016,7080f25d-5f69-41bc-95b7-473aef1715e8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/24/071050.full.pdf
pcaReduce: Hierarchical Clustering of Single Cell Transcriptional Profiles,"Justina Zurauskiene, Christopher Yau",Now published in BMC Bioinformatics. 2015,"Advances in single cell genomics provides a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression experiments is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied to single cell data, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies.

Here, we present a novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchi- cal clustering to create a framework for characterising cell state identity. Our methodology uses agglomerative clustering to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cellular states. We demonstrate that using real single cell datasets this approach allows for consistent clustering of single cell transcriptional profiles across multiple scales of interpretation.

However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a non-linear change of time scale -- analogous to the Kingman coalescent -- we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analogue, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately from whole-genome data. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology.

However, the FPC is engaged in other cognitive functions including prospective memory, relational reasoning, episodic memory retrieval and attentional set-shifting, which are not directly linked to the notion of cognitive branching.

Here, via the use of two-dimensional Hermite (TDH) functions, we identify a covert symmetry in high-order statistics of natural images that simplifies this task.  This emerges from the structure of TDH functions, which are an orthogonal set of functions that are organized into a hierarchy of ranks.  Specifically, we find that the shape (skewness and kurtosis) of the distribution of filter coefficients depends only on the projection of the function onto a 1-dimensional subspace specific to each rank.  The characterization of natural image statistics provided by TDH filter coefficients reflects both their phase and amplitude structure, and we suggest an intuitive interpretation for the special subspace within each rank.","['huqinpku@hotmail.com', 'jdvicto@med.cornell.edu', 'jdvicto@med.cornell.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/27/060947,biorxiv,2016,85a7483c-fb54-4f92-8cf5-2ae0d72af67c,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/27/060947.full.pdf

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful technique for transcriptome profiling of the organisms that uses the capabilities of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.

Here, we present the bagging support vector machines (bagSVM), a machine learning approach and bagged ensembles of support vector machines (SVM), for classification of RNA-Seq data. The bagSVM basically uses bootstrap technique and trains each single SVM separately; next it combines the results of each SVM model using majority-voting technique.
Results
We demonstrate the performance of the bagSVM on simulated and real datasets. Simulated datasets are generated from negative binomial distribution under different scenarios and real datasets are obtained from publicly available resources. A deseq normalization and variance stabilizing transformation (vst) were applied to all datasets. We compared the results with several classifiers including Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA), single SVM, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forests (RF). In slightly overdispersed data, all methods, except CART algorithm, performed well. Performance of PLDA seemed to be best and RF as second best for very slightly and substantially overdispersed datasets. While data become more spread, bagSVM turned out to be the best classifier. In overall results, bagSVM and PLDA had the highest accuracies.
Conclusions
According to our results, bagSVM algorithm after vst transformation can be a good choice of classifier for RNA-Seq datasets mostly for overdispersed ones. Thus, we recommend researchers to use bagSVM algorithm for the purpose of classification of RNA-Seq data. PLDA algorithm should be a method of choice for slight and moderately overdispersed datasets.

We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects in the human cortex: splicing of 3,198 genes is influenced by genetic variation. sQTLs are enriched among those variants influencing DNA methylation and histone acetylation. In assessing known AD loci, we report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU, and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Further, we leverage our sQTL catalog to identify genes whose aberrant splicing is associated with AD and mediated by genetics. This transcriptome-wide association study identified 21 genes with significant associations, many of which are found in AD GWAS loci, but 8 are in novel AD loci, including FUS, which is a known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) gene. This highlights an intriguing shared genetic architecture that is further elaborated by the convergence of old and new AD genes in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways already implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, this study of the aging brain's transcriptome provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of AD and is, in some genetically-driven cases, causal.","['towfique.raj@mssm.edu', 'pld2115@cumc.columbia.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/10/174565,biorxiv,2017,2ded2cfe-885a-429f-b118-238f34a9e30d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/10/174565.full.pdf

Direct protein measurements are typically limited due to issues of cost and scale; however, the recent development of high-throughput, targeted sentinel mass spectrometry assays provides an opportunity for proteomics to contribute at a meaningful scale in high-value areas for drug development. To demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic and comprehensive library of perturbational proteomic signatures, we profiled 90 drugs (in triplicate) in six cell lines using two different proteomic assays -- one measuring global changes of epigenetic marks on histone proteins and another measuring a set of peptides reporting on the phosphoproteome -- for a total of more than 3,400 samples. This effort represents a first-of-its-kind resource for proteomics. The majority of tested drugs generated reproducible responses in both phosphosignaling and chromatin states, but we observed differences in the responses that were cell line- and assay-specific. We formalized the process of comparing response signatures within the data using a concept called connectivity, which enabled us to integrate data across cell types and assays. Furthermore, it facilitated incorporation of transcriptional signatures. Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended cell-specific effects, while consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs that were confirmed by experimental follow-up. We further demonstrated how the resource could be leveraged against public domain external datasets to recognize therapeutic hypotheses that are consistent with ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

Deep Residual Network Reveals a Nested Hierarchy of Distributed Cortical Representation for Visual Categorization,"Haiguang Wen, Junxing Shi, Wei Chen, Zhongming Liu",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"What enables humans to readily recognize visual objects is attributed to how the brain extracts, represents, and organizes object information from visual input. To understand this process, we used a deep residual network as a hierarchical computational model of visual categorization to predict cortical representation of natural vision. We trained and tested such a predictive encoding model with functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human subjects watching hours of natural video clips, and verified its ability to predict cortical responses to novel images, objects, and categories. We further used the so trained encoding model to synthesize cortical responses to 64,000 visual objects from 80 categories, revealing hierarchical, distributed, and overlapping cortical representations of categories. Such category representations covered both the ventral and dorsal pathways, reflected multiple levels and domains of visual features, and preserved semantic relationships between categories. In the scale of the entire visual cortex, category representations were modularly organized into three categories: biological objects, non-biological objects, and background scenes. In a smaller scale specific to each module, category representation further revealed sub-modules for finer categorization, e.g. biological objects were categorized into terrestrial animals, aquatic animals, humans, and plants. Such nested spatial and representational hierarchies were attributable to different levels of category information to varying degrees. These findings suggest that increasingly more specific category information is represented by cortical patterns in progressively finer spatial scales - an important principle for the brain to categorize visual objects in various levels of abstraction.",['zmliu@purdue.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/21/151142,biorxiv,2017,45abb307-db84-47e4-9e29-498d67b4f420,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/21/151142.full.pdf

Methods: The study protocol has been published at DOI: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8.  Design: Observational cohort study.  Population: Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after May 1st 2013.  Intervention: Mandatory completion of a checklist at the point of manuscript revision.  Comparators: (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; (2) Similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic.  Primary Outcome: Change in proportion of Nature publications describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the Landis 4 items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation, exclusions).  We included 448 NPG papers (223 published before May 2013, 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used Pubmed Related Citations to identify 448 non-NPG papers with a similar topic and date of publication in other journals; and then redacted all publications for time sensitive information and journal name. Redacted manuscripts were assessed by 2 trained reviewers against a 74 item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third.  Results: 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG publications described in vivo research. The number of NPG publications meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4%) after (2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, chi-squared = 36.2, df = 1, p = 1.8 x 10-9).

The Case for Pyriproxyfen as a Potential Cause for Microcephaly; From Biology to Epidemiology,"Yaneer Bar-Yam, H. Frederik Nijhout, Raphael Parens, Felipe Costa, Alfredo J. Morales",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The Zika virus has been the primary suspect in the large increase in incidence of microcephaly in 2015-6 in Brazil. However its role is not confirmed despite individual cases in which viral infections were found in neural tissue. Recently, the disparity between the incidences in different geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here we consider the alternative possibility that the use of the insecticide pyriproxyfen for control of mosquito populations in Brazilian drinking water is the primary cause. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog that was approved as an insecticide based upon tests performed in the 1970s, has metabolites that bind to the mammalian retinoid X receptor, and has been shown to cause developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via maternal exposure and activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly-incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres-in exposed rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented-it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, and have not been adequately confirmed. Given this combination of information about molecular mechanisms and toxicological evidence, we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal link to microcephaly is investigated further.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/10/115279,biorxiv,2017,f26d7b00-94df-4da1-8c2a-630cfd59d0b6,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/10/115279.full.pdf

Here we use C. elegans genome sequencing of pms-2 and mlh-1 knockouts to reveal the mutational patterns linked to C. elegans MMR deficiency and their dependency on endogenous replication errors and errors caused by deletion of the polymerase ε subunit pole-4. Signature extraction from 215 human colorectal and 289 gastric adenocarcinomas revealed three MMR-associated signatures one of which closely resembles the C. elegans MMR spectrum. A characteristic difference between human and worm MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG>NTG mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures may reflect the interaction between MMR deficiency and other mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In summary, combining information from genetically defined models and cancer samples allows for better aligning mutational signatures to causal mutagenic processes.","['a.gartner@dundee.ac.uk', 'moritz.gerstung@ebi.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/13/149153,biorxiv,2017,c85aa196-cf47-4805-90e3-9f7a21659804,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/13/149153.full.pdf

Blocking Otx2 transfer in the adult, which induces plasticity, resulted in Gadd45b/g upregulation and changes in MeCP2 foci.

Although use of these methods has increased, automated methods have some notable limitations: pairwise correspondences are frequently inaccurate or lack transitivity (i.e., they are not defined with reference to the full sample). In this study, we reassess the accuracy of two previously published automated methods, cPDist [1] and auto3Dgm [2], and evaluate several modifications to these methods. We show that a substantial fraction of alignments and pairwise maps between specimens of highly dissimilar geometries were inaccurate in the study of Boyer et al.

We also show these inaccuracies can be remedied by utilizing a globally informed methodology within a collection of shapes, instead of only comparing shapes in a pairwise manner (c.f. [2]). Unfortunately, while global information generally enhances maps between dissimilar objects, it can degrade the quality of correspondences between similar objects due to the accumulation of numerical error. We explore a number of approaches to mitigate this degradation, quantify the performance of these approaches, and compare the generated pairwise maps (as well as the shape space characterized by these maps) to a ""ground truth"" obtained from landmarks manually collected by geometric morphometricians.

Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), using either feedforward and recurrent architectures, have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term “neural network” suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNN models abstract from many details of biological neural networks. Their abstractions contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual tasks (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control tasks (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs have been shown to predict neural responses to novel sensory stimuli that cannot be predicted with any other currently available type of model. DNNs can have millions of parameters (connection strengths), which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for task performance. These parameters are often set by task training using stochastic gradient descent.

We show with an unprecedented level of precision, that irrelevant sensory features of contrast, frequency and phase are only encoded transiently. Conversely, the relevant feature of angle is encoded and maintained in a distributed and dynamically changing manner throughout the brief retention period. Furthermore, although the visibility of the stimulus correlates with an amplification of late neural codes, we show that unseen stimuli can be partially maintained in the corresponding neural assemblies.

To determine whether alanine substitutions are always the best choice, we analyzed 34,373 mutations in fourteen proteins whose effects were measured using large-scale mutagenesis approaches. We found that several substitutions, including histidine and asparagine, are better at recapitulating the effects of other substitutions.

Pattern Component Modeling: A Flexible Approach For Understanding The Representational Structure Of Brain Activity Patterns,"Joern Diedrichsen, Atsushi Yokoi, Spencer Arbuckle",Now published in NeuroImage. 2017,"Representational models specify how complex patterns of neural activity relate to visual stimuli, motor actions, or abstract thoughts. Here we review pattern component modeling (PCM), a practical Bayesian approach for evaluating such models. Similar to encoding models, PCM evaluates the ability of models to predict novel brain activity patterns. In contrast to encoding models, however, the activity of individual voxels across conditions (activity profiles) are not directly fitted. Rather, PCM integrates over all possible activity profiles and computes the marginal likelihood of the data under the activity profile distribution specified by the representational model. By using an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood, PCM allows the fitting of flexible representational models, in which the relative strength and form of the encoded features can be estimated from the data. We discuss here a number of different forms with which such flexible representational models can be specified, and how models of different complexity can be compared. We then provide a number of practical examples from our recent work in motor control, ranging from fixed models to more complex non-linear models of brain representations.

Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?,Romain Brette,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"""Neural coding"" is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the implied communication channel consists of both the experimental and biological system. Thus, the terms ""neural code"" are used inappropriately when ""neuroexperimental code"" would be more accurate, although less insightful. Second, the brain cannot be presumed to decode neural messages into objective properties of the world, since it never gets to observe those properties. To avoid dualism, codes must relate not to external properties but to internal sensorimotor models. Because this requires structured representations, neural assemblies cannot be the basis of such codes. Third, a message is informative to the extent that the reader understands its language. But the neural code is private to the encoder since only the message is communicated: each neuron speaks its own language. It follows that in the neural coding metaphor, the brain is a Tower of Babel. Finally, the relation between input signals and actions is circular; that inputs do not preexist to outputs makes the coding paradigm problematic. I conclude that the view that spikes are messages is generally not tenable. An alternative proposition is that action potentials are actions on other neurons and the environment, and neurons interact with each other rather than exchange messages.",['romain.brette@inserm.fr'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/168237,biorxiv,2017,88d3bcd7-c80b-4cf8-b384-b29b17964570,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/168237.full.pdf

We demonstrate the utility of MutPred2 in the identification of the structural and functional mutational signatures relevant to Mendelian disorders and the prioritization of de novo mutations associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorders.

Commonly believed to either perform path integration or localization, the true objective of grid cells, their hexagonal grid fields, and especially their discrete scales remain puzzling. Here it is proposed that grid cells efficiently encode transitions in sequences. A biologically plausible model for dendritic computation in grid cells is presented. A network of competitive cells shows positive gridness scores early in simulations and realigns the orientation of all cells over time. Then, a scale-space model of grid cells is introduced. It improves behaviorally questionable run-times of a single scale significantly by look-ahead in multiple scales, and it is shown that the optimal scale-increment between consecutive scales is √2. Finally, a formal theory for sequences and transitions is stated. It is demonstrated that hexagonal transition encoders are optimal to encode transitions in Euclidean space and emerge due to the sampling theorem.

Different types of retrotransposons share common replication machinery and yet occupy distinct genomic domains. Autonomous long interspersed elements accumulate in gene-poor domains and their non-autonomous short interspersed elements accumulate in gene-rich domains. To determine genomic factors that contribute to this discrepancy we analysed the distribution of retrotransposons within the framework of chromosomal domains and regulatory elements. Using comparative genomics, we identified large-scale conserved patterns of retrotransposon accumulation across several mammalian genomes. Importantly, retrotransposons that were active after our sample-species diverged accumulated in orthologous regions. This suggested a conserved interaction between retrotransposon activity and conserved genome architecture. In addition, we found that retrotransposons accumulated at regulatory element boundaries in open chromatin, where accumulation of particular retrotransposon types depended on insertion size and local regulatory element density. From our results, we propose a model where density and distribution of genes and regulatory elements canalise the accumulation of retrotransposons.

Our results are in concordance with earlier findings that postzygotic de novo CNV events are typically rare in genomic DNA derived from saliva or blood and, in the majority of MZ twins, do not explain the discordance of NDDs.

One of the possible approaches to determine the most probable deleterious variants in individual exomes is to use protein function alteration prediction. We propose in this paper to use a machine learning approach, the random forest to build a new meta-score based on five previously described scores (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, PhyloP and MutationTaster) and compiled in the dbNSFP database.
The functional meta-score was trained on a dataset of 61500 non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).

In particular, we focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, a common type of dataset generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers the regulatory (causal) relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression, particularly ridge regression, using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions.

It is of increasing importance for studying the human auditory nervous system due to numerous associations with auditory cognition and dysfunction. Although the FFR is widely interpreted as originating from brainstem nuclei, a recent study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggested that there is also a right-lateralized contribution from the auditory cortex at the fundamental frequency (Coffey et al., 2016c). Our objectives in the present work were to validate and better localize this result using a completely different neuroimaging modality, and document the relationships between the FFR and the onset response, and cortical activity. Using a combination of electroencephalography, fMRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging, we show that activity in the right auditory cortex is related to individual differences in FFR-f0 strength, a finding that was replicated with two independent stimulus sets, with and without acoustic energy at the fundamental frequency. We demonstrate a dissociation between this FFR-f0-sensitive response in the right and an area in left auditory cortex that is sensitive to individual differences in the timing of initial response to sound onset. Relationships to timing and their lateralization are supported by parallels in the microstructure of the underlying white matter, implicating a mechanism involving neural conduction efficiency. These data confirm that the FFR has a cortical contribution, and suggest ways in which auditory neuroscience may be advanced by connecting early sound representation to measures of higher-level sound processing and cognitive function.","['emily@flighteducation.net', 'emz.coffey@mail.mcgill.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/21/076448,biorxiv,2016,1f67a865-488d-4651-87bf-bae880c4e68d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/21/076448.full.pdf

Harnessing Big Data for Systems Pharmacology,"Lei Xie, Eli Draizen, Philip Bourne",Now published in Annual Review Of Pharmacology And Toxicology. 2016,"Systems pharmacology aims to holistically understand genetic, molecular, cellular, organismal, and environmental mechanisms of drug actions through developing mechanistic or predictive models. Data-driven modeling plays a central role in systems pharmacology, and has already enabled biologists to generate novel hypotheses. However, more is needed. The drug response is associated with genetic/epigenetic variants and environmental factors, is coupled with molecular conformational dynamics, is affected by possible off-targets, is modulated by the complex interplay of biological networks, and is dependent on pharmacokinetics. Thus, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of drug actions, systems pharmacology requires integration of models across data modalities, methodologies, organismal hierarchies, and species. This imposes a great challenge on model management, integration, and translation. Here, we discuss several upcoming issues in systems pharmacology and potential solutions to them using big data technology.

Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size > 2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 34 articles, including 30 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohen's d of 0.4-0.5 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61-64%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis.

Although this fits with the known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory argues that there is a computational trade-off between learning the specifics of individual experiences and regularities that hold across those experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a neural network model that instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and subfields to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We found that the monosynaptic pathway - the pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to region CA1 - was able to support statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway - connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate gyrus and CA3 - learned only individual episodes, with apparent representations of regularities resulting from associative reactivation through recurrence.

Detection and characterization of low and high genome coverage regions using an efficient running median and a double threshold approach.,"Dimitri Desvillechabrol, Christiane Bouchier, Sean Kennedy, Thomas Cokelaer",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Motivation: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) provides researchers with powerful tools to investigate both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetics. An accurate assessment of reads mapped to a specific genome consists of inspecting the genome coverage as number of reads mapped to a specific genome location. Most current methods use the average of the genome coverage (sequencing depth) to summarize the overall coverage. This metric quickly assess the sequencing quality but ignores valuable biological information like the presence of repetitive regions or deleted genes. The detection of such information may be challenging due to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous coverage regions, a mixture of  underlying models or the presence of a non-constant trend along the genome. Using robust statistics to systematically identify genomic regions with unusual coverage is needed to characterize these regions more precisely.
Results: We implemented an efficient running median algorithm to estimate the genome coverage trend. The distribution of the normalized genome coverage is then estimated using a Gaussian mixture model. A z-score statistics is then assigned to each base position and used to separate the central distribution from the regions of interest (ROI) (i.e., under- and over-covered regions). Finally, a double threshold mechanism is used to cluster the genomic ROIs. HTML reports provide a summary with interactive visual representations of the genomic ROIs.

Control without controllers: Towards a distributed neuroscience of executive control,"Benjamin Eisenreich, Rei Akaishi, Benjamin Hayden",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Executive control refers to the regulation of cognition and behavior by mental processes and is a hallmark of higher cognition. Most approaches to understanding its mechanisms begin with the assumption that our brains have anatomically segregated and functionally specialized control modules.

An alternative approach sees executive control as self-organizing principles of a distributed organization. In distributed systems, control and controlled processes are co-localized within large numbers of dispersed computational agents. Control then is often an emergent consequence of simple rules governing the interaction between agents. Because these systems are unfamiliar and unintuitive, here we review several well-understood examples of distributed control systems, group living insects and social animals, and emphasize their parallels with neural systems.

Along the California coast, summertime fog has the potential to ameliorate drought conditions and thus reduce plant flammability during a critical time of elevated fire risk. This study investigated the uptake of dry season fog and how it affects live fuel moisture in six dominant shrub species from chaparral and sage scrub plant associations. Fog water uptake was evaluated using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen at several field sites in Santa Barbara County, California. Clear evidence of fog water uptake was identified only in Baccharis pilularis, from the sage scrub association. To determine the effects of fog on live fuel moisture, meteorological variables and indices including fog deposition were combined into principal components and the scores regressed against the live fuel moisture loss rate during the summer drought. Fog deposition slowed rates of live fuel moisture loss for all three sage scrub species tested, but it did not affect the chaparral species. Fog is a more regular occurrence in the sage scrub association and thus it is likely that fog ameliorates drought for species that experience consistent fog during the summer months. In coastal California, summer fog can be essential to plant water relations and reduce live fuel moisture loss rates during the summer drought.

Noradrenergic plasticity of olfactory sensory neuron inputs to the main olfactory bulb,"Dennis Eckmeier, Stephen David Shea",Now published in Journal of Neuroscience. 2014,"Sensory responses are modulated throughout the nervous system by internal factors including attention, experience, and brain state. This is partly due to fluctuations in neuromodulatory input from regions such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem. LC activity changes with arousal and modulates sensory processing, cognition and memory. The main olfactory bulb (MOB) is richly targeted by LC fibers and noradrenaline profoundly influences MOB circuitry and odor-guided behavior. Noradrenaline-dependent plasticity affects the output of the MOB. However, it is unclear whether noradrenergic plasticity includes modulation in the glomerular layer, the site of input to the MOB. Noradrenergic terminals are found in the glomerular layer, but noradrenaline receptor activation does not seem to acutely modulate olfactory sensory neuron terminals in vitro. We investigated whether noradrenaline induces plasticity at the glomerulus. We used wide-field optical imaging to measure changes in odor responses following electrical stimulation of locus coeruleus in anesthetized mice. Surprisingly, the odor-evoked intrinsic optical signals at the glomerulus were persistently weakened after LC activation. Calcium imaging selectively from olfactory sensory neurons confirmed that this effect was due to a uniform gain suppression of presynaptic input, and did not require exposure to a stimulus during the LC activation. Finally, noradrenaline antagonists prevented glomerular suppression. We conclude that noradrenaline release from LC has persistent effects on odor processing already at the first synapse of the main olfactory system. This mechanism could contribute to arousal-dependent memories.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/08/12/002550,biorxiv,2014,2768fc77-a781-47be-9282-c8a40624bdac,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/08/12/002550.full.pdf
The Evaluative Role of Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Rule-Based Category Learning,"Dmitrii Paniukov, Tyler Davis",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Category learning is a critical neurobiological function that allows organisms to simplify a complex world. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) is often active in neurobiological studies of category learning. rlPFC has been associated in the previous category learning literature with switching between rules and tasks that place higher demands on rule abstraction and evaluation. The goal of the present study was to clarify the role of rlPFC in category learning and dissociate switching and evaluation accounts. Two common types of category learning tasks, matching and classification, were utilized. The matching task involved matching a reference stimulus to one of four target stimuli. In the classification task, participants were shown a single stimulus and learned to classify it into one of two categories. Although nearly identical, matching and classification place differential demands on switching and evaluation. In matching, a rule can be known with certainty after a single correct answer. In classification, participants may need to evaluate evidence for a rule even after an initial correct response. This critical difference allows isolation of evaluative functions from switching functions. If the rlPFC is primarily involved in switching between representations, it should cease to be active once participants settle on a given rule in both tasks. If the rlPFC is involved in rule evaluation, its activation should persist in the classification task, but not matching. The results revealed that rlPFC activation persisted into correct trials in classification, but not matching, suggesting that it continues to be involved in the evaluations of evidence for a rule even after participants have arrived at the correct rule.","['dmitrii.paniukov@gmail.com', 'tyler.h.davis@ttu.edu', 'dmitrii.paniukov@gmail.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/11/107110,biorxiv,2017,8982044b-7d26-4928-bf31-f7f5da8c99c4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/11/107110.full.pdf

Current computational approaches evaluating loss-of-function in genes carrying these variants rely on gene-level characteristics such as evolutionary conservation and functional redundancy across the genome. However, innate immunity genes represent a particular case because they are more likely to be under positive selection and duplicated.

While neural networks can be computationally expensive to train, we introduce several novel strategies to significantly reduce the overhead. By visualizing the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory grammar.

FastNet: Fast and accurate inference of phylogenetic networks using large-scale genomic sequence data,"Hussein Hejase, Natalie VandePol, Gregory A Bonito, Kevin J Liu",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and phylogenomics have reshaped our understanding of evolutionary biology. One primary outcome is the emerging discovery that interspecific gene flow has played a major role in the evolution of many different organisms across the Tree of Life. To what extent is the Tree of Life not truly a tree reflecting strict ""vertical"" divergence, but rather a more general graph structure known as a phylogenetic network which also captures ""horizontal"" gene flow?
The answer to this fundamental question not only depends upon densely sampled and divergent genomic sequence data, but also computational methods which are capable of accurately and efficiently inferring phylogenetic networks from large-scale genomic sequence datasets. Recent methodological advances have attempted to address this gap. However, in a recent performance study, we demonstrated that the state of the art falls well short of the scalability requirements of existing phylogenomic studies. The methodological gap remains: how can phylogenetic networks be accurately and efficiently inferred using genomic sequence data involving many dozens or hundreds of taxa? In this study, we address this gap by proposing a new phylogenetic divide-and-conquer method which we call FastNet. Using synthetic and empirical data spanning a range of evolutionary scenarios, we demonstrate that FastNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and topological accuracy.
We predict an imminent need for new computational methodologies that can cope with dataset scale at the next order of magnitude, involving thousands of genomes or more. We consider FastNet to be a next step in this direction. We conclude with thoughts on the way forward through future algorithmic enhancements.","['kjl@msu.edu', 'journals.permissions@oup.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/01/132795,biorxiv,2017,c687c551-0569-49d4-a8e0-6f63ebc1f026,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/01/132795.full.pdf

Early survival and delayed death of developmentally-born dentate gyrus neurons,"Shaina P Cahill, Ru Qi Yu, Dylan C Green, Evgenia V Todorova,  View ORCID ProfileJason Scott Snyder",Now published in Hippocampus. 2017,"The storage and persistence of memories depends on plasticity in the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis produces new neurons that mature through critical periods for plasticity and cellular survival, which determine their contributions to learning and memory. However, most granule neurons are generated prior to adulthood; the maturational timecourse of these neurons is poorly understood compared to adult-born neurons, but is essential to identify how the dentate gyrus, as a whole, contributes to behavior. To characterize neurons born in the early postnatal period, we labeled dentate gyrus neurons born on postnatal day 6 (P6) with BrdU and quantified maturation and survival across early (1 hour to 8 weeks old) and late (2-6 months old) cell ages. We find that the dynamics of developmentally-born neuron survival is essentially the opposite of neurons born in adulthood: P6-born neurons did not go through a period of cell death during their immature stages (from 1-8 weeks). In contrast, 17% of P6-born neurons died after reaching maturity, between 2-6 months of age. Delayed death was evident from the loss of BrdU+ cells as well as pyknotic BrdU+caspase3+ neurons within the superficial granule cell layer. Patterns of DCX, NeuN and activity-dependent Fos expression indicate that developmentally-born neurons mature over several weeks and a sharp peak in zif268 expression at 2 weeks suggests that developmentally-born neurons mature faster than adult-born neurons (which peak at 3 weeks). Collectively, our findings are relevant for understanding how developmentally-born dentate gyrus neurons contribute to memory and disorders throughout the lifespan. High levels of early survival and zif268 expression may promote learning, while also rendering neurons sensitive to insults at defined stages. Late neuronal death in young adulthood may result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dentate gyrus neurons, which could impact memory persistence and contribute to hippocampal/dentate gyrus atrophy in disorders such as depression.",['jasonscottsnyder@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/23/092957,biorxiv,2017,6b2ba08d-bb9e-47b6-8fd8-937e6ce7fa34,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/23/092957.full.pdf

The impact of the newly licensed dengue vaccine in endemic countries,"Maira Aguiar, Scott B. Halstead, Nico Stollenwerk",Now published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. 2016,"Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes a tetravalent vaccine is needed to protect against the huge burden of dengue disease. Dengvaxia is a vaccine candidate now licensed in several countries for individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic countries with least 70% of seroprevalence. Modelers from Sanofi Pasteur have predicted that this vaccine has the potential to reduce by about 50% the disease burden within 5 years when 20% of an endemic country population is vaccinated, thus achieving a World Health Organization dengue prevention goal. 

In this paper, mathematical modeling is used to investigate the impact of the newly licensed dengue vaccine using different scenarios. Our results show that to achieve significant reduction in disease burden, the vaccination program is most effective if it includes only individuals that have been already exposed to at least one dengue virus. Immunological screening of the population prior to vaccination is advised and vaccination strategies must be planned based on epidemiological disease dynamics for each specific endemic region.

Interpreting Temporal Fluctuations In Resting-State Functional Connectivity MRI,"Raphael Liegeois, Timothy O. Laumann, Abraham Z. Snyder, Juan Zhou,  View ORCID ProfileB. T. Thomas Yeo",Now published in NeuroImage. 2017,"Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that dFC might be attributed to sampling variability of static FC. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of dFC is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians.

We first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all FC measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models (HMM) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of dFC. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization (PR) and autoregressive randomization (ARR) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary HMM due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of ARR (bivariate ARR) is susceptible to false positives compared with PR and an adapted version of ARR (multivariate ARR). 

Application of PR and multivariate ARR to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static FC can fully explain dFC. We find that first order AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than static FC models. Since first order AR models encode both static FC and one-lag FC, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static FC. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than a popular HMM, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state fMRI). Overall, our results suggest that AR models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing dFC literature might be reconciled.",['R.Liegeois@nus.edu.sg'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/135681,biorxiv,2017,9d94a8d1-3eb5-47b7-a1c6-bb89adfeb4cc,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/135681.full.pdf
Scientific Theories and Artificial Intelligence," View ORCID ProfilePhilippe Desjardins-Proulx,  View ORCID ProfileTimothée Poisot,  View ORCID ProfileDominique Gravel",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Artificial Intelligence presents an important paradigm shift for science. Science is traditionally founded on theories and models, most often formalized with mathematical formulas handcrafted by theoretical scientists and refined through experiments. Machine learning, an important branch of modern Artificial Intelligence, focuses on learning from data. This leads to a fundamentally different approach to model-building: we step back and focus on the design of algorithms capable of building models from data, but the models themselves are not designed by humans. This is even more true with deep learning, which requires little engineering by hand and is responsible for many of Artificial Intelligence's spectacular successes. In contrast to logic systems, knowledge from a deep learning model is difficult to understand, reuse, and may involve up to a billion parameters. On the other hand, probabilistic machine learning techniques such as deep learning offer an opportunity to tackle large complex problems that are out of the reach of traditional theory-making. It is possible that the more intuition-like reasoning performed by deep learning systems is mostly incompatible with the logic formalism of mathematics. Yet recent studies have shown that deep learning can be useful to logic systems and vice versa. Success at unifying different paradigms of Artificial Intelligence from logic to probability theory offers unique opportunities to combine data-driven approaches with traditional theories.

Adaptive Somatic Mutations Calls with Deep Learning and Semi-Simulated Data,"Remi Torracinta, Laurent Mesnard, Susan Levine, Rita Shaknovich, Maureen Hanson, Fabien Campagne",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"A number of approaches have been developed to call somatic variation in high-throughput sequencing data. Here, we present an adaptive approach to calling somatic variations. Our approach trains a deep feed-forward neural network with semi-simulated data. Semi-simulated datasets are constructed by planting somatic mutations in real datasets where no mutations are expected. Using semi-simulated data makes it possible to train the models with millions of training examples, a usual requirement for successfully training deep learning models. We initially focus on calling variations in RNA-Seq data. We derive semi-simulated datasets from real RNA-Seq data, which offer a good representation of the data the models will be applied to. We test the models on independent semi-simulated data as well as pure simulations. On independent semi-simulated data, models achieve an AUC of 0.973.  When tested on semi-simulated exome DNA datasets, we find that the models trained on RNA-Seq data remain predictive (sens ~0.4 & spec ~0.9 at cutoff of P>=0.9), albeit with lower overall performance (AUC=0.737). Interestingly, while the models generalize across assay, training on RNA-Seq data lowers the confidence for a group of mutations. Haloplex exome specific training was also performed, demonstrating that the approach can produce probabilistic models tuned for specific assays and protocols. We found that the method adapts to the characteristics of experimental protocol.

We performed simultaneous extracellular field and unit recordings in four connected areas of the freely moving rat (S1BF, V1M, perirhinal cortex, CA1). S1BF spiking activity was strongly entrained by both beta and gamma S1BF oscillations, which were associated with deactivations and activations, respectively. We identified multiple classes of fast spiking and excitatory cells in S1BF, which showed prominent differences in rhythmic entrainment and in the extent to which phase locking was modulated by behavioral state. Using an additional dataset acquired by whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice, these cell classes could be compared with identified phenotypes showing gamma rhythmicity in their membrane potential. We next examined how S1BF cells were entrained by rhythmic fluctuations in connected brain areas. Gamma-synchronization was detected in all four areas, however we did not detect significant  gamma coherence among these areas. Instead, we only found long-range coherence in the theta-beta range among these areas. In contrast to local S1BF synchronization, we found long-range S1BF-spike to CA1-LFP synchronization to be homogeneous across inhibitory and excitatory cell types.

The feature-weighted receptive field: an interpretable encoding model for complex feature spaces.,"Ghislain St-Yves, Thomas Naselaris",Now published in NeuroImage. 2017,"We introduce the feature-weighted receptive field (fwRF), an encoding model designed to balance expressiveness, interpretability and scalability. The fwRF is organized around the notion of a feature map---a transformation of visual stimuli into visual features that preserves the topology of visual space (but not necessarily the native resolution of the stimulus). The key assumption of the fwRF model is that activity in each voxel encodes variation in a spatially localized region across multiple feature maps. This region is fixed for all feature maps; however, the contribution of each feature map to voxel activity is weighted. Thus, the model has two separable sets of parameters: ""where"" parameters that characterize the location and extent of pooling over visual features, and ""what"" parameters that characterize tuning to visual features. The ""where"" parameters are analogous to classical receptive fields, while ""what"" parameters are analogous to classical tuning functions. By treating these as separable parameters, the fwRF model complexity is independent of the resolution of the underlying feature maps. This makes it possible to estimate models with thousands of high-resolution feature maps from relatively small amounts of data. Once a fwRF model has been estimated from data, spatial pooling and feature tuning can be read-off directly with no (or very little) additional post-processing or in-silico experimentation.

We describe an optimization algorithm for estimating fwRF models from data acquired during standard visual neuroimaging experiments. We then demonstrate the model's application to two distinct sets of features: Gabor wavelets and features supplied by a deep convolutional neural network. We show that when Gabor feature maps are used, the fwRF model recovers receptive fields and spatial frequency tuning functions consistent with known organizational principles of the visual cortex. We also show that a fwRF model can be used to regress entire deep convolutional networks against brain activity. The ability to use whole networks in a single encoding model yields state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. Our results suggest a wide variety of uses for the feature-weighted receptive field model, from retinotopic mapping with natural scenes, to regressing the activities of whole deep neural networks onto measured brain activity.","['stayves@musc.edu', 'tnaselar@musc.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/11/126318,biorxiv,2017,169cf2f6-0030-4f0e-825b-8db4200bd410,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/11/126318.full.pdf
Gating mass cytometry data by deep learning,"Huamin Li, Uri Shaham, Kelly P Stanton, Yi Yao, Ruth Montgomery, Yuval Kluger",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single
cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New
methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and
interpretation of data generated in large studies. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of
cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps, untenable for larger studies.
We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating, based on deep learning
techniques. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain
adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between
a target distribution and a source distribution in an unsupervised manner. We show that Deep-
CyTOF is highly concordant (98%) with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating
of each sample when applied to a collection of 16 biological replicates of primary immune blood
cells, even when measured accross several instruments. Further, DeepCyTOF achieves very high
accuracy on the semi-automated gating challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition as well as two
CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i) 14 subjects with a history of infection

Conditioning by Subthreshold Synaptic Input Changes the Characteristic Firing Pattern of CA3 Hippocampal Neurons,"Saray Soldado Magraner, Federico Brandalise, Suraj Honnuraiah, Michael Pfeiffer, Urs Gerber, Rodney Douglas",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Neurons are typically classified according to their intrinsic firing patterns and distinctive morphological features. However, our experiments in the CA3 field of rat hippocampus in vitro revealed that discharge patterns change significantly following a short period of low frequency subthreshold stimulation of the neuron's afferents. This effect could be reproduced by intrasomatic current pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors. Cluster analysis of the firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the initial pattern exhibited by the cell. Using a conductance-based model, we demonstrate that the observed transitions can be mediated by recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances.

Gene nucleotide composition accurately predicts expression and is linked to topological chromatin domains,"Chloe Bessiere, May Taha, Forent Petitprez, Jimmy Vandel, Jean-Michel Marin, Laurent Brehelin, Sophie Lebre, Charles-Henri Lecellier",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Gene expression is orchestrated by distinct regulatory regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers, UTRs) to ensure a wide variety of cell types and functions. A challenge is to identify which regulatory regions are active, what are their associated features and how they work together in each cell type. Several approaches have tackled this problem by modeling gene expression based on epigenetic marks (e.g. ChIP-seq, methylation, DNase hypersensitivity), with the ultimate goal of identifying driving genomic regions and mutations that are clinically relevant in particular in precision medicine. However, these models rely on experimental data, which are limited to specific samples (even often to cell lines) and cannot be generated for all regulators and all patients. In addition, we show here that, although these approaches are accurate in predicting gene expression, their biological interpretation can be misleading. Finally these methods are not designed to capture potential regulation instructions present at the sequence level, before the binding of regulators or the opening of the chromatin. We develop here a method for predicting mRNA levels based solely on sequence features collected from distinct regulatory regions, which is as accurate as methods based on experimental data. Our approach confirms the importance of nucleotide composition in predicting gene expression and ranks regulatory regions according to their contribution. It also unveils strong influence of gene body sequence, in particular introns. We further provide evidence that the contribution of nucleotide content can be linked to co-regulations associated with genome 3D architecture and to associations of genes within topologically associated domains.","['brehelin@lirmm.fr', 'sophie.lebre@umontpellier.fr', 'charles.lecellier@igmm.cnrs.fr', 'extra@cted']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/16/117499,biorxiv,2017,f946c3ca-5cae-48fc-ad31-b5cff2c5c397,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/16/117499.full.pdf
Recurrent convolutional neural networks: a better model of biological object recognition,"Courtney J Spoerer, Patrick McClure, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Feedforward neural networks provide the dominant model of how the brain performs visual object recognition. However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and nonhuman primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, BT, BL, and BLT), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, digit clutter (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and digit debris (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognising objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent networks were also found to be more robust to the inclusion of additive Gaussian noise. Recurrent neural networks are better in two respects: (1) they are more neurobiologically realistic than their feedforward counterparts; (2) they are better in terms of their ability to recognise objects, especially under challenging conditions.

Single Cell Expression Data Reveal Human Genes that Escape X-Chromosome Inactivation,"Kerem Wainer-Katsir, Michal Linial",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Sex chromosomes pose an inherent genetic imbalance between genders. In mammals, one of the female’s X-chromosomes undergoes inactivation (Xi). Indirect measurements estimate that about 20% of Xi genes completely or partially escape inactivation. The identity of these escapee genes and their propensity to escape inactivation remain unsolved. A direct method for identifying escapees was applied by quantifying differential allelic expression from single cells. RNA-Seq fragments were assigned to informative SNPs which were labeled by the appropriate parental haplotype. This method was applied for measuring allelic specific expression from Chromosome-X (ChrX) and an autosomal chromosome as a control. We applied the protocol for measuring biallelic expression from ChrX to 104 primary fibroblasts. Out of 215 genes that were considered, only 13 genes (6%) were associated with biallelic expression. The sensitivity of escapees' identification was increased by combining SNP mapping for parental diploid genomes together with RNA-Seq from clonal single cells (25 lymphoblasts). Using complementary protocols, referred to as strict and relaxed, we confidently identified 25 and 31escapee genes, respectively. When pooled versions of 30 and 100 cells were used, <50% of these genes were revealed. We assessed the generality of our protocols in view of an escapee catalog compiled from indirect methods. The overlap between the escapee catalog and the genes’ list from this study is statistically significant (P-value of E-07). We conclude that single cells’ expression data are instrumental for studying X-inactivation with an improved sensitivity. Finally, our results support the emerging notion of the non-deterministic nature of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation.","['kerem.wainer@mail.huji.ac.il', 'michall@cc.huji.ac.il', 'gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/09/079830,biorxiv,2016,6a08a755-d9a4-4924-9a50-6496465a4e43,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/09/079830.full.pdf

Generalising Better: Applying Deep Learning To Integrate Deleteriousness Prediction Scores For Whole-Exome SNV Studies,"Ilia Korvigo, Andrey Afanasyev, Nikolay Romashchenko, Mihail Skoblov",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Many automatic classifiers were introduced to aid inference of phenotypical effects of uncategorised nsSNVs (nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Variations) in theoretical and medical applications. Lately, several meta-estimators have been proposed that combine different predictors, such as PolyPhen and SIFT, to integrate more information in a single score. Although many advances have been made in feature design and machine learning algorithms used, the shortage of high-quality reference data along with the bias towards intensively studied in vitro models call for improved generalisation ability in order to further increase classification accuracy and handle records with insufficient data. Since a meta-estimator basically combines different scoring systems with highly complicated nonlinear relationships, we investigated how deep learning (supervised and unsupervised), which is particularly efficient at discovering hierarchies of features, can improve classification performance. While it is believed that one should only use deep learning for high-dimensional input spaces and other models (logistic regression, support vector machines, Bayesian classifiers, etc) for simpler inputs, we still believe that the ability of neural networks to discover intricate structure in highly heterogenous datasets can aid a meta-estimator. We compare the performance with various popular predictors, many of which are recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), as well as available deep learning-based predictors. Thanks to hardware acceleration we were able to use a computationally expensive genetic algorithm to stochastically optimise hyper-parameters over many generations. Overfitting was hindered by noise injection and dropout, limiting coadaptation of hidden units.

Stimuli reduce the dimensionality of cortical activity,"Luca Mazzucato, Alfredo Fontanini, Giancarlo La Camera",Now published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience. 2016,"The activity of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons can be represented as a set of points in the space of firing rates. Even though the dimension of this space is equal to the ensemble size, neural activity can be effectively localized on smaller subspaces. The dimensionality of the neural space is an important determinant of the computational tasks supported by the neural activity. Here, we investigate the dimensionality of neural ensembles from the sensory cortex of alert rats during periods of ongoing (inter-trial) and stimulus-evoked activity. We find that dimensionality grows linearly with ensemble size, and grows significantly faster during ongoing activity compared to evoked activity. We explain these results using a spiking network model based on a clustered architecture. The model captures the difference in growth rate between ongoing and evoked activity and predicts a characteristic scaling with ensemble size that could be tested in high-density multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, we present a simple theory that predicts the existence of an upper bound on dimensionality. This upper bound is inversely proportional to the amount of pair-wise correlations and, compared to a homogeneous network without clusters, it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical estimation of such bounds depends on the number and duration of trials and is well predicted by the theory.

Different tastes for different individuals,Kohei Fujikura,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2014,"Individual taste differences were first reported in the first half of the 20th century, but the primary reasons for these differences have remained uncertain. Much of the taste variation among different mammalian species can be explained by pseudogenization of taste receptors. In this study, by analyzing 14 ethnically diverse populations, we investigated whether the most recent disruptions of taste receptor genes segregate with their intact forms. Our results revealed an unprecedented prevalence of segregating loss-of-function (LoF) taste receptor variants, identifying one of the most pronounced cases of functional population diversity in the human genome. LoF variant frequency was considerably higher than the overall mutation rate, and many humans harbored varying numbers of critical mutations. In particular, molecular evolutionary rates of sour and bitter receptors were far higher in humans than those of sweet, salty, and umami receptors compared with other carnivorous mammals although not all of the taste receptors genes were identified.

Predicting double-strand DNA breaks using epigenome marks or DNA at kilobase resolution,"Raphael Mourad, Olivier Cuvier",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) result from the attack of both DNA strands by multiple sources, including exposure to ionizing radiation or reactive oxygen species. DSBs can cause abnormal chromosomal rearrangements which are linked to cancer development, and hence represent an important issue. Recent techniques allow the genome-wide mapping of DSBs at high resolution, enabling the comprehensive study of DSB origin. However these techniques are costly and challenging. Hence we devised a computational approach to predict DSBs using the epigenomic and chromatin context, for which public data are available from the ENCODE project. We achieved excellent prediction accuracy (AUC=0.97) at high resolution (<1 kb), and showed that only chromatin accessibility and H3K4me1 mark were sufficient for highly accurate prediction (AUC=0.95). We identified chromatin accessibility, activity and long-range contacts as best predictors.

SWS2 visual pigment evolution as a test of historically contingent patterns of plumage color evolution in Warblers,"Natasha Bloch, James M Morrow, Belinda SW Chang, Trevor D Price",Now published in Evolution. 2015,"Distantly related clades that occupy similar environments may differ due to the lasting imprint of their ancestors – historical contingency. The New World warblers (Parulidae) and Old World warblers (Phylloscopidae) are ecologically similar clades that differ strikingly in plumage coloration. We studied genetic and functional evolution of the short-wavelength sensitive visual pigments (SWS2 and SWS1) to ask if altered color perception could contribute to the plumage color differences between clades. We show SWS2 is short-wavelength shifted in birds that occupy open environments, such as finches, compared to those in closed environments, including warblers. Sequencing of opsin genes and phylogenetic reconstructions indicate New World warblers were derived from a finch-like form that colonized from the Old World 15-20Ma. During this process the SWS2 gene accumulated 6 substitutions in branches leading to New World warblers, inviting the hypothesis that passage through a finch-like ancestor resulted in SWS2 evolution. In fact, we show spectral tuning remained similar across warblers as well as the finch ancestor. Results reject the hypothesis of historical contingency based on opsin spectral tuning, but point to evolution of other aspects of visual pigment function. Using the approach outlined here, historical contingency becomes a generally testable theory in systems where genotype and phenotype can be connected.","['nbloch@uchicago.edu', 'belinda.chang@utoronto.ca', 'pricet@uchicago.edu', 'james.morrow@utoronto.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/09/013573,biorxiv,2015,ea4f7710-aace-46bb-8e8e-0a8daf873672,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/09/013573.full.pdf

Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of western and far eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6. By ~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","['reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'wolfgang.haak@adelaide.edu.au', 'nrohland@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'wolfgang.haak@adelaide.edu.au', 'wolfgang.haak@adelaide.edu.au', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'nickp@broadinstitute.org', 'lazaridis@genetics.med.harvard.edu', 'reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433,biorxiv,2015,a952098d-b300-4b84-bde7-023c4551fc10,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433.full.pdf

Gaykalova, Christine H. Chung, Elana J. Fertig",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background: Targeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of genes that are critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease control is rarely observed. Knowing the timing of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance can enable optimization of alterations to patients treatments. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer model. 
Results: An unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, quantified the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Further applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time-course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes resulted from immediate therapeutic response and resistance whereas epigenetic alterations only occurred with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrated delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance was stabilized epigenetically. 
Conclusions: Genes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that had concordant expression changes were hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings are a relevant step into the better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.","['gsteinobrien@jhmi.edu', 'ltsukam1@jhmi.edu', 'sli61@jhu.edu', 'mthakar3@jhmi.edu', 'Ruchira.Ranaweera@moffitt.org', 'ozakky@cb.mbn.or.jp', 'haixia.cheng@hci.utah.edu', 'mconsid3@jhmi.edu', 'favorov@sensi.org', 'ldanilo1@jhmi.edu', 'jcalifano@ucsd.edu', 'izumchen@jhmi.edu', 'dgaykal1@jhmi.edu', 'Christine.Chung@moffitt.org', 'ejfertig@jhmi.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/136564,biorxiv,2017,d9a80bd2-30ae-4a01-82e2-9efcbe2a9f52,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/01/136564.full.pdf

To test if the two copies might have different functions, we examined expression levels of malvolio in brain, fat bodies, Malpighian tubules, midgut, ovaries, testes and thoracic musculature in the beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that mvl1 was expressed in all tissues, with highest expression in fat bodies and relatively lower expression in testes, Malpighian tubules, and brain, and ovaries. Expression of mvl2 differed, with significant expression only seen in brain and midgut. Because malvolio has been implicated in behavior, and these beetles have highly developed parenting behavior, we next examined expression during different behavioral states including virgin, mating, preparing resources for offspring, feeding offspring and post care. We found differing expression patterns for the two copies, with mvl1 increasing in expression during resource preparation and feeding offspring, and mvl2 decreasing in these same states.

We manipulated line drawings of real-world environments such that statistics of contour orientations or junctions were disrupted. Manipulated and intact line drawings were presented to participants in an fMRI experiment. Scene categories were decoded from neural activity patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA) and other visual brain regions. Disruption of junctions but not orientations led to a drastic decrease in decoding accuracy in the PPA and OPA, indicating the reliance of these areas on intact junction statistics. Accuracy of decoding from early visual cortex, on the other hand, was unaffected by either image manipulation. We further show that the correlation of error patterns between decoding from the scene-selective brain areas and behavioral experiments is contingent on intact contour junctions.

"Genome-wide regulatory model from MPRA data predicts functional regions, eQTLs, and GWAS hits","Yue Li, Alvin Shi, Ryan Tewhey, Pardis Sabeti, Jason Ernst, Manolis Kellis",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable unprecedented opportunities to test for regulatory activity of thousands of regulatory sequences. However, MPRA only assay a subset of the genome thus limiting their applicability for genome-wide functional annotations. To overcome this limitation, we have used existing MPRA datasets to train a machine learning model that uses DNA sequence information, regulatory motif annotations, evolutionary conservation, and epigenomic information to predict genomic regions that show enhancer activity when tested in MPRA assays. We used the resulting model to generate global predictions of regulatory activity at single-nucleotide resolution across 14 million common variants. We find that genetic variants with stronger predicted regulatory activity show significantly lower minor allele frequency, indicative of evolutionary selection within the human population. They also show higher overlap with eQTL annotations across multiple tissues relative to the background SNPs, indicating that their perturbations in vivo more frequently result in changes in gene expression. In addition, they are more frequently associated with trait-associated SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), enabling us to prioritize genetic variants that are more likely to be causal based on their predicted regulatory activity. Lastly, we use our model to compare MPRA inferences across cell types and platforms and to prioritize the assays most predictive of MPRA assay results, including cell-dependent DNase hypersensitivity sites and transcription factors known to be active in   the tested cell types. Our results indicate that high-throughput testing of thousands of putative regions, coupled with regulatory predictions across millions of sites, presents a powerful strategy for systematic annotation of genomic regions and genetic variants.","['liyue@mit.edu', 'manoli@mit.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/20/110171,biorxiv,2017,2b4e35cc-bc61-416d-880c-0f25cb20f31e,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/20/110171.full.pdf
SOMSC: Self-Organization-Map for High-Dimensional Single-Cell Data of Cellular States and Their Transitions,"Tao Peng, Qing Nie",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Measurement of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provides a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the cellular state transition relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying the cellular states, identifying their transitions among those states, and extracting the pseudotime ordering of cells are challenging due to the noise in the data and the high-dimensionality in the number of genes in the data. In this paper we adapt the classical self-organizing-map (SOM) approach for single-cell gene expression data (SOMSC), such as those based on single cell qPCR and single cell RNA-seq. In SOMSC, a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in the population of the measured single cells.   Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers among the basins in CSM provide information on transitions among the cellular states. A cellular state transitions path (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are consequently obtained. In addition, SOMSC could estimate the cellular state replication probability and transition probabilities. Applied to a set of synthetic data, one single-cell qPCR data set on mouse early embryonic development and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets, SOMSC shows effectiveness in capturing cellular states and their transitions presented in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broader applications to analyzing cellular fate specification and cell lineages using single cell gene expression data.",['qnie@math.uci.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/24/124693,biorxiv,2017,ead28a6c-fd3b-462f-849f-707dcec44ffa,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/24/124693.full.pdf

Materials and Methods: Three radiologists annotated 1,400 head CT reports for language indicating the presence or absence of acute communicable findings (hemorrhage, stroke, hydrocephalus, and mass effect). This set was used to train, develop, and evaluate a non-neural classifier, support vector machine (SVM), in comparisons to two neural network models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and neural attention model (NAM) Inter-rater agreement was computed using kappa statistics. Accuracy, receiver operated curves, and area under the curve were calculated and tabulated. P-values <0.05 was significant and 95% confidence intervals were computed.  Results: Radiologist agreement was 86-94% and Cohen kappa was 0.667-0.762 (substantial agreement). Accuracies of the CNN and NAM (range 0.90-0.94) were higher than SVM (range 0.88-0.92). NAM showed relatively equal accuracy with CNN for three classes, severity, mass effect, and hydrocephalus, higher accuracy for the acute bleed class, and lower accuracy for the acute stroke class. AUCs of all methods for all classes were above 0.92.  Conclusions: 1. Neural network models (CNN & NAM) generally had higher accuracies compared to the non-neural models (SVM) and have a range of accuracies that comparable to the inter-annotator agreement of three neuroradiologists. 2.

Inferring Functional Neural Connectivity With Deep Residual Convolutional Networks,"Timothy W Dunn, Peter K.

While this connectivity is traditionally revealed by anatomical methods such as electron microscopy, an efficient alternative is to computationally infer functional connectivity from recordings of neural activity. However, these statistical techniques still require further refinement before they can be reliably applied to real data. Here, we report significant improvements to a deep learning method for functional connectomics, as assayed on synthetic ChaLearn Connectomics data. The method, which integrates recent advances in convolutional neural network architecture and model-free partial correlation coefficients, outperforms published methods on competition data and can achieve over 90% precision at 1% recall on validation datasets. This suggests that future application of the model to in vivo whole-brain imaging data in larval zebrafish could reliably recover on the order of 106 synaptic connections with a 10% false discovery rate.

Quantitative RNAseq Meta Analysis Of Alternative Exon Usage In C. elegans,"Nicolas J. Tourasse, Jonathan R. M. Millet, Denis Dupuy",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Almost twenty years after the completion of the C. elegans genome sequence, gene structure annotation is still an ongoing process with new evidence for gene variants still being regularly uncovered by additional in-depth transcriptome studies. While alternative splice forms can allow a single gene to encode several functional isoforms the question of how much spurious splicing is tolerated is still heavily debated. Here we gathered a compendium of 1,682 publicly available C. elegans RNAseq datasets to increase the dynamic range of detection of RNA isoforms and obtained robust measurements of the relative abundance of each splicing event. While most of the splicing reads come from reproducibly detected splicing events, a large fraction of purported junctions are only supported by a very low number of reads. We devised an automated curation method that takes into account the expression level of each gene to discriminate robust splicing events from potential biological noise. We found that rarely used splice sites disproportionately come from highly expressed genes and are significantly less conserved in other nematode genomes than splice sites with a higher usage frequency. Our increased detection power confirmed trans-splicing for at least 84% of C. elegans protein coding genes. The genes for which trans-splicing was not observed are overwhelmingly low expression genes, suggesting that the mechanism is pervasive but not full captured by organism-wide RNA-Seq. We generated annotated gene models including quantitative exon usage information for the entire C. elegans genome.

VIP36 preferentially binds to core-fucosylated N-glycans: a molecular docking study,Klaus Fiedler,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Alpha 1-6 fucosyltransferase (Fut8) is known for its properties as an enhancer of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastasis and as a suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep3B). Promising candidates of affected molecules include E-cadherin. In its absence, during epithelial-mesenchymal transition,the pathway triggers signaling to the nucleus via β-catenin-TCF/LEF. Contrarily, in less metastatic tumors, Fut8 stimulates cell-cell adhesion. Regulated classes of molecules could also include the sorting machinery of polarized epithelial cells, sorted ligands or both, that may be altered in cellular transformation. I have analyzed here the cargo receptor VIP36 (Vesicular-integral membrane protein of 36 kD) for carbohydrate interaction. It has been described as a lectin in the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment), Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. The docking reveals top-interacting carbohydrates of the N-glycan and O-glycan class that encompass N-linked glycans of high mannose and equally complex type which likely function as sorted ligands in epithelial cells. O-glycans score lower and include core 2 residue binding. I show that fucose core modifications by Fut8 stimulate binding of N-linked glycans to VIP36, which is known to be different from binding of galectins 3 and 9. This suggests that Fut8-upregulation may directly alter the affinity of sorted cargo and may enhance the sorting to the apical pathway as exemplified in hepatocytes and traffic to bile. High affinity binding of the ganglioside GM1 carbohydrate headgroup to VIP36 suggests a linkage with protein and glycosphingolipid apical transfer in epithelial cells. Thus, this fundamental approach with large scale docking of 165 carbohydrates including 19 N-glycan high mannose, 17 Nglycan hybrid, 9 N-glycan complex, 17 O-glycan core, 27 Sialoside, 25 Fucoside and 51 other glycan residues suggests, that linked cargo-receptor apical transport may provide a path to epithelial polarization that may be modulated by core fucosylation.",['contact@klausfiedler.ch'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092460,biorxiv,2016,628e63f0-8b51-4bca-b7cc-af31bd47fd69,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092460.full.pdf
Iroki: automatic customization for phylogenetic trees,"Ryan M Moore, Amelia O Harrison, Sean M McAllister, Rachel L Marine, Clara S Chan, K. Eric Wommack",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Background
Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for examining species and community diversity, and the evolutionary history of species.  In the case of microorganisms, decreasing sequencing costs have enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups.  However, phylogenetic analyses of large sequence datasets present challenges to extracting meaningful trends from complex trees.  Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree, including label color, branch color, and other features.  Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience.  To address these limitations, we developed Iroki, a program for fast, automatic customization of phylogenetic trees.  Iroki allows the user to incorporate information on a broad range of metadata for each experimental unit represented in the tree.

Results
Iroki was applied to four existing microbial sequence datasets to demonstrate its utility in data exploration and presentation.  Specifically, we used Iroki to highlight connections between viral phylogeny and host taxonomy, explore the abundance of microbial groups associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in cattle, examine short-term temporal dynamics of virioplankton communities, and to search for trends in the biogeography of Zetaproteobacteria.

Conclusions
Iroki is an easy-to-use application having both command line and web-browser implementations for fast, automatic customization of phylogenetic trees based on user-provided categorical or continuous metadata.  Iroki enables hypothesis testing through improved visualization of phylogenetic trees, streamlining the process of biological sequence data exploration and presentation.

The Superior Colliculus And The Steering Of Saccades Toward A Moving Visual Target,"Laurent Goffart, Aaron L. Cecala, Neeraj Gandhi",Now published in Journal of Neurophysiology. 2017,"Following the suggestion that a command encoding the expected here-and-now target location feeds the oculomotor system during interceptive saccades, we tested whether this command originates in the deep superior colliculus (SC). Monkeys generated saccades to targets that were static or moving along the preferred axis, away from (outward) or toward a fixated target (inward) with a constant speed (20 degrees/s). Vertical and horizontal motions were also tested. Extracellular activity of 57 saccade-related neurons was recorded in 3 monkeys. The movement field (MF) parameters (boundaries, center and firing rate) were estimated after spline fitting the relation between the saccade amplitude and the average firing rate of the motor burst. During radial motion, the inner MF boundary shifted in the same direction as the target motion for some neurons, not all. During vertical motion, both lower and upper boundaries were shifted upward during upward motion whereas the upper boundary only shifted during downward motions. For horizontal motions, the medial boundaries were not changed. The MF center was shifted only for outward motion. Regardless of the motion direction, the average firing rate was consistently reduced during interceptive saccades. Our study shows an involvement of the saccade-related burst of SC neurons in steering the gaze toward a moving target. When observed, the shifts of MF boundary in the direction of target motion correspond to commands related to antecedent target locations. The absence of shift in the opposite direction shows that SC activity does not issue predictive commands related to the future target location.",['laurent.goffart@univ-amu.fr.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/03/133736,biorxiv,2017,ff297e4d-f4e7-4256-84a4-1f8059e6180d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/03/133736.full.pdf

Analysis of the long 3′ UTR of IMPA1 indicated that a multiprotein complex including Upf1, HuD and Ago2 mediated 3′ UTR cleavage. This event enhanced IMPA1 translation and was necessary for maintaining axon integrity. 3′ UTR cleavage took place in axons and was not limited to IMPA1 but extended to other transcripts with similar expression patterns.

We will focus on the distinctive oscillatory profiles of the SZ and ASD brains, in turn using these insights to refine our understanding of how the brain computes language by exploring a novel model of linguistic feature-set composition. We will argue that brain rhythms constitute the best route to interpreting language deficits in both conditions and mapping them to neural dysfunction and risk alleles of the genes. Importantly, candidate genes for SZ and ASD are overrepresented among the gene sets believed to be important for language evolution.

Here, we have investigated the regulations targeting the biogenesis of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the macromolecular assembly mediating nucleocytoplasmic exchanges. Systematic analysis of RNA-binding proteins interactomes, together with in vivo and in vitro assays, revealed that a subset of NPC mRNAs are specifically bound by Hek2, a yeast hnRNP K-like protein. Hek2-dependent NPC mRNAs translational repression and protein turnover are further shown to finely tune the levels of NPC subunits. Strikingly, Hek2 binding to its target mRNAs requires prior desumoylation by the NPC-associated SUMO protease Ulp1. Mutations or physiological perturbations altering NPC integrity lead to a decrease in the levels of active Ulp1 and to the accumulation of sumoylated, inactive forms of Hek2.

The global impact of Wolbachia on mitochondrial diversity and evolution,"Marie Cariou, Laurent Duret, Sylvain Charlat",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The spread of maternally inherited microorganisms, such as Wolbachia bacteria, can induce indirect selective sweeps on host mitochondria, to which they are linked within the cytoplasm. The resulting reduction in effective population size might lead to smaller mitochondrial diversity and reduced efficiency of natural selection. Although suggested by a few case studies, the global consequences of this process on mitochondrial diversity and evolution remains to be assessed. Here we address this question using a mapping of Wolbachia acquisition/extinction events on a large mitochondrial DNA tree, including over 1,000 species.

These findings validate the conjecture that the widespread distribution of Wolbachia infections throughout arthropods impacts the effective population size of mitochondria.

Fixing the stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy in task fMRI,"Jacob Westfall, Thomas Nichols, Tal Yarkoni",Now published in Wellcome Open Research. 2016,"Most fMRI experiments record the brain's responses to samples of stimulus materials (e.g., faces or words). Yet the statistical modeling approaches used in fMRI research universally fail to model stimulus variability in a manner that affords population generalization--meaning that researchers' conclusions technically apply only to the precise stimuli used in each study, and cannot be generalized to new stimuli. A direct consequence of this stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy is that the majority of published fMRI studies have likely overstated the strength of the statistical evidence they report. Here we develop a Bayesian mixed model (the random stimulus model; RSM) that addresses this problem, and apply it to a range of fMRI datasets. Results demonstrate considerable inflation (50-200% in most of the studied datasets) of test statistics obtained from standard ""summary statistics""-based approaches relative to the corresponding RSM models. We demonstrate how RSMs can be used to improve parameter estimates, properly control false positive rates, and test novel research hypotheses about stimulus-level variability in human brain responses.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/12/077131,biorxiv,2016,49d336d9-6629-4ec8-8551-f3b79139374a,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/12/077131.full.pdf
Medial frontal theta is entrained to the lick cycle,"Linda M. Amarante, Marcelo S. Caetano, Mark Laubach",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC], a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multi-electrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher and lower value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 sec periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats' lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 sec added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent medial frontal cortex, is synchronized to the lick cycle.",['mark.laubach@american.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/144550,biorxiv,2017,b2966933-8d7b-482a-936d-12d7124fa596,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/144550.full.pdf

Because flies exhibit saccadic visual behaviors and their compound eyes have relatively few ommatidia (sampling points), their photoreceptors would be expected to generate blurry and coarse retinal images of the world. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila see the world far better than predicted from the classic theories. By using electrophysiological, optical and behavioral assays, we found that R1-R6 photoreceptors' encoding capacity in time is maximized to fast high-contrast bursts, which resemble their light input during saccadic behaviors. Whilst over space, R1-R6s resolve moving objects at saccadic speeds beyond the predicted motion-blur-limit. Our results show how refractory phototransduction and rapid photomechanical photoreceptor contractions jointly sharpen retinal images of moving objects in space-time, enabling hyperacute vision, and explain how such microsaccadic information sampling exceeds the compound eyes' optical limits.

We introduce an open source package Basset (https://github.com/davek44/Basset) to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq and demonstrate far greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility.

We present a data analysis method for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow-band steady-state response in the frequency and time-frequency domains. The method, termed rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), is based on denoising source separation approaches that take advantage of the simultaneous but differential projection of neural activity to many non-invasively placed electrodes or sensors. Our approach is a combination and extension of existing multivariate source separation methods. We demonstrate that RESS performs well on both simulated and empirical data, and outperforms conventional SSEP analysis methods based on selecting electrodes with the strongest SSEP response.

Reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks based on Repairing Sparse Low-rank Matrices,"Young Hwan Chang, Roel Dobbe, Palak Bhushan, Joe W. Gray, Claire J. Tomlin",Now published in IEEE/ACM Transactions On Computational Biology And Bioinformatics. 2014,"With the growth of high-throughput proteomic data, in particular time series gene expression data from various perturbations, a general question that has arisen is how to organize inherently heterogenous data into meaningful structures. Since biological systems such as breast cancer tumors respond differently to various treatments, little is known about exactly how these gene regulatory networks (GRNs) operate under different stimuli. For example, when we apply a drug-induced perturbation to a target protein, we often only know that the dynamic response of the specific protein may be affected. We do not know by how much, how long and even whether this perturbation affects other proteins or not. Challenges due to the lack of such knowledge not only occur in modeling the dynamics of a GRN but also cause bias or uncertainties in identifying parameters or inferring the GRN structure. This paper describes a new algorithm which enables us to estimate bias error due to the effect of perturbations and correctly identify the common graph structure among biased inferred graph structures. To do this, we retrieve common dynamics of the GRN subject to various perturbations. We refer to the task as ""repairing"" inspired by ""image repairing"" in computer vision. The method can automatically correctly repair the common graph structure across perturbed GRNs, even without precise information about the effect of the perturbations. We evaluate the method on synthetic data sets and demonstrate advantages over l1-regularized graph inference by advancing our understanding of how these networks respond across different targeted therapies.

Neurons in primate entorhinal cortex represent gaze position in multiple spatial reference frames,"Miriam L. R. Meister, Elizabeth A. Buffalo",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Primates predominantly rely on vision to gather information from the environment, and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005, Solstad et al. 2008, Sargolini et al., 2006, Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position, and that simultaneously recorded neurons exhibit distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligning to the visual image and others aligning to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates, and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.",['mmeister@uw.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/30/182220.1,biorxiv,2017,43dc6d1a-75de-4d8a-ae64-7b13f9bcf5d5,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/30/182220.1.full.pdf

Methods to Reduce Sea Turtle Interactions in the Atlantic Canadian Pelagic Long Line Fleet,Zachary Thomas Sherker,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"This project investigates the role of fisheries management in the conservation of loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), both of which are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). These species migrate from nesting grounds in South America to feed on gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfish) in the North Atlantic off the coast of the United States and Canada. The seasonal foraging grounds of sea turtles heavily overlap with areas of high fishing effort for the longline tuna and swordfish fleet, a fishery that has significantly high rates of sea turtle incidents. The dynamic nature of sea turtle foraging patterns renders static spatio-temporal fishing area closures ineffective. Rather, turtle by-catch mitigation requires small-scale, event-triggered closures and decentralized management to reduce incidents while minimizing the negative socio-economic impact of area closures on fishermen.

The Cultural Evolution of Hard-to-fake Rituals,Karl Frost,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"It has been proposed that costly rituals act as honest signals of commitment to group beliefs when such rituals appear dysphoric and unappealing (costly) to non-believers, but appealing to true believers  (Irons, 2001). If only true believers are willing to endure ritual behaviors and true belief also entails belief in altruistic cooperation, associating with other ritual practitioners can help solve cooperation dilemmas in groups by sorting out potential free-riders. While this hypothesis is obviously true if such 'faking' of ritual is strictly impossible, strict impossibility seems implausible. 'Faking' is defined by Irons in this context to be to be performing the ritual without commitment to group beliefs. In this paper, I posit various ways that such faking might be difficult, instead of impossible, or different ways in which such ritual faking might be 'costly' and then formally model the social learning and cultural evolution dynamics to see where it may still hold theoretically that such rituals help maintain altruism in group and under what conditions. Analytic solution for evolutionary equilibrium is derived for each model, verifying that under a wide range of conditions for some, but not all interpretations, such hard-to fake rituals can help groups solve cooperative dilemmas, including in some circumstances that might not be intuitively obvious, such as where such free-riding is not visible and free-riders successfully represent themselves as true believers to observers.
It is also the case that while there has been some progress in cleaning up the definitional confusions in the animal signaling literature around costly signaling, the literature on human rituals as costly signals has introduced novel uses of the term 'cost'. Theories referring to completely different mechanisms or even definitions of 'cost' are sometimes conflated. To contextualize the analysis of costly-to-fake rituals, this paper provides a review of the ideas proposed in the literature on costly human rituals and differentiates them from costly signaling as used in the animal behavior literature.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/060640,biorxiv,2016,2b76c149-6b1c-4905-988d-4d22bd1fc19d,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/060640.full.pdf

Odorant cues linked to social immunity induce lateralized antenna stimulation in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),"Alison McAfee, Troy F Collins, Lufiani L Madilao, Leonard J Foster",Now published in Scientific Reports. 2016,"Hygienic behaviour (HB) is a social immunity trait in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) whereby workers detect, uncap and remove unhealthy brood, improving disease resistance in the colony. This is clearly economically valuable; however, the molecular mechanism behind it is not well understood. The freeze-killed brood (FKB) assay is the conventional method of HB selection, so we compared odour profiles of FKB and live brood to find candidate HB-inducing odours. Surprisingly, we found that significantly more brood pheromone (β-ocimene) was released from FKB. β-ocimene abundance also positively correlated with HB, suggesting there could be a brood effect contributing to overall hygiene. Furthermore, we found that β-ocimene stimulated worker antennae in a dose-dependent manner, with the left antennae responding significantly stronger than right antennae in hygienic bees, but not in non-hygienic bees. This suggests that HB depends not only on odour detection, but also lateralization of sensitivity.

Exonic mosaic mutations contribute risk for autism spectrum disorder,"Deidre R Krupp, Rebecca A Barnard, Yannis Duffourd, Sara Evans, Ryan M Mulqueen, Raphael Bernier, Jean-Baptiste Rivière, Eric Fombonne,  View ORCID ProfileBrian J O'Roak",Now published in The American Journal of Human Genetics. 2017,"Genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Postzygotic mosaic mutations (PMMs) have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and overgrowth syndromes. We systematically evaluated PMMs by leveraging whole-exome sequencing data on a large family-based ASD cohort, the Simons Simplex Collection. We found evidence that 11% of published single nucleotide variant (SNV) de novo mutations are potentially PMMs. We then developed a robust SNV PMM calling approach that leverages complementary callers, logistic regression modeling, and additional heuristics. Using this approach, we recalled SNVs and found that 22% of de novo mutations likely occur as PMMs in children. Unexpectedly, we found a significant burden of synonymous PMMs in probands that are predicted to alter splicing. We found no evidence of missense PMM burden in the full cohort. However, we did observe increased signal for missense PMMs in families without germline mutations in probands, which strengthens in genes intolerant to mutations. We also determined that 7-11% of parental mosaics are transmitted to children. Parental mosaic mutations make up 6.8% of all mutations newly germline in children, which has important implications for recurrence risk. PMMs intersect previously implicated high confidence and other ASD candidate risk genes, further suggesting that this class of mutations contribute to ASD risk. We also identified PMMs in novel candidate risk genes involved with chromatin remodeling or neurodevelopment. We estimate that PMMs contribute risk to 4-8% of simplex ASD cases.

Principled Multi-Omic Analysis Reveals Gene Regulatory Mechanisms Of Phenotype Variation," View ORCID ProfileCasey Hanson,  View ORCID ProfileJunmei Cairns, Liewei Wang, Saurabh Sinha",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Recent studies have analyzed large scale data sets of gene expression to identify genes associated with inter-individual variation in phenotypes ranging from cancer sub-types to drug sensitivity, promising new avenues of research in personalized medicine. However, gene expression data alone is limited in its ability to reveal cis-regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences. In this study, we develop a new probabilistic model, called pGENMi, that integrates multi-omics data to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation of a specific phenotype - that of cell line response to cytotoxic treatment. In particular, pGENMi simultaneously analyzes genotype, DNA methylation, gene expression and transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding data, along with phenotypic measurements, to identify TFs regulating the phenotype. It does so by combining statistical information about expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and expression-correlated methylation marks (eQTMs) located within TF binding sites, as well as observed correlations between gene expression and phenotype variation. Application of pGENMi to data from a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with 24 drugs, in conjunction with ENCODE TF ChIP data, yielded a number of known as well as novel TF-drug associations. Experimental validations by TF knock-down confirmed 41% of the predicted and tested associations, compared to a 12% confirmation rate of tested non-associations (controls). Extensive literature survey also corroborated 62% of the predicted associations above a stringent threshold. Moreover, associations predicted only when combining eQTL and eQTM data showed higher precision compared to an eQTL-only or eQTM-only analysis with the same method, further demonstrating the value of multi-omic integrative analysis.","['sinhas@illinois.edu', 'Wang.Liewei@mayo.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/02/145607,biorxiv,2017,0b4dada1-4b2d-4285-ae81-65b9de9798c8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/02/145607.full.pdf

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as  a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors.  We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor.

Maternal immune activation dysregulation of the fetal brain transcriptome and relevance to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder,"Michael V Lombardo, Hyang Mi Moon, Jennifer Su, Theo D Palmer, Eric Courchesne, Tiziano Pramparo",Now published in Molecular Psychiatry. 2016,"Maternal immune activation (MIA) via infection during pregnancy is known to increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it is unclear how MIA disrupts fetal brain gene expression in ways that may explain this increased risk. Here we examine how MIA dysregulates fetal brain gene expression near the end of the first trimester of human gestation in ways relevant to ASD-associated pathophysiology. MIA downregulates expression of ASD- associated genes, with the largest enrichments in genes known to harbor rare highly penetrant mutations. MIA also downregulates expression of many genes also known to be persistently downregulated in ASD cortex later in life and which are canonically known for roles in affecting prenatally-late developmental processes at the synapse. Transcriptional and translational programs that are downstream targets of highly ASD-penetrant FMR1 and CHD8 genes are also heavily affected by MIA. MIA strongly upregulates expression of a large number of genes involved in translation initiation, cell cycle, DNA damage, and proteolysis processes that affect multiple key neural developmental functions. Upregulation of translation initiation is common to and preserved in gene network structure with the ASD cortical transcriptome throughout life and has downstream impact on cell cycle processes. The cap-dependent translation initiation gene, EIF4E, is one of the most MIA-dysregulated of all ASD-associated genes and targeted network analyses demonstrate prominent MIA-induced transcriptional dysregulation of mTOR and EIF4E-dependent signaling. This dysregulation of translation initiation via alteration of the Tsc2-mTor-Eif4e-axis was further validated across MIA rodent models. MIA may confer increased risk for ASD by dysregulating key aspects of fetal brain gene expression that are highly relevant to pathophysiology affecting ASD.","['mvlombardo@gmail.com', 'tpramparo@ucsd.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/21/064683,biorxiv,2016,3302a6c4-9bd9-41f1-bac2-420c31adee94,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/21/064683.full.pdf

An approximation of the error back-propagation algorithm in a predictive coding network with local Hebbian synaptic plasticity,"James Whittington, Rafal Bogacz",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error back-propagation algorithm. However, in the back-propagation algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the back-propagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the back-propagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.",['rafal.bogacz@ndcn.ox.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/23/035451,biorxiv,2016,b788dd1c-0f07-4940-bd7e-2682ef062050,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/23/035451.full.pdf

We complement existing repositories with manually-corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study.

Findings: Skull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on non local segmentation technique (BEaST) software and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was reiterated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images.

Capturing the Difference in Humoral Immunity between Normal and Tumor Environments from RNA Sequences of B-Cell Receptors Using Supervised Machine Learning,"Hiroki Konishi, Daisuke Komura, Hiroto Katoh, Shinichiro Atsumi, Hirotomo Koda, Asami Yamamoto, Seto Yasuyuki, Masashi Fukayama, Rui Yamaguchi, Seiya Imoto, Shumpei Ishikawa",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Motivation: The success of immunotherapy in treating tumors has been attracting increasing interest in the adaptive immune system in the tumor microenvironment in recent years. Progress in next-generation sequencing technology now enables sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulin (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissue have high affinity for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of amino acid sequences of BCRs/Igs might differ in the normal and tumor environment. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rare recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCRs/Igs sequences compared to obtaining similar information for TCRs. The aim of this study was to capture this difference by applying supervised machine learning methods to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens of 90 patients with gastric cancer.  Results: We adopted two approaches to evaluate the possibility of accurately differentiating BCRs/Igs amino acid sequences of the tumor environment. First, we used two kinds of discriminative models for sequence classification between normal and tumor tissues. One takes into account only V and J frame usages and the other deals with the physicochemical properties of amino acid sequences. The results demonstrated clear differences in the physicochemical properties of amino acid sequences between BCRs/Igs derived from normal and tumor tissues, which could not be captured by applying V and J frame usage alone. In the second approach, we assumed a diagnostic situation in which a set of BCR/Ig-sequences is available for each patient, and we classified normal and tumor tissues based on the BCR sequences. Combining BCR/Ig-level classifiers and the Shannon entropy of the BCRs/Igs repertoire, we achieved an area under the curve value of 0.834, suggesting that BCRs/Igs repertoires have sufficient environment-specific features, which can be used to determine the tissue type.  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCRs/Igs sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, indicating that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCRs/Igs repertoires.

Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the ‘null space’ of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to support memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing.

However, this shared ancestry hides a more complex history whereby at least four distinct streams of Eurasian migration have contributed to present-day and prehistoric Native American populations. Whole genome studies enhanced by technological breakthroughs in ancient DNA now provide evidence of a sequence of events involving initial migration from a structured Northeast Asian source population, followed by a divergence into northern and southern Native American lineages. During the Holocene, new migrations from Asia introduced the Saqqaq/Dorset Paleoeskimo population to the North American Arctic ~4,500 years ago, ancestry that is potentially connected with ancestry found in Athabaskan-speakers today.  This was then followed by a major new population turnover in the high Arctic involving Thule-related peoples who are the ancestors of present-day Inuit.

Slotkin, Stephen Roberts, Michael F. Berger, Meera Hameed, David Solit, Marc Ladanyi, Neerav Shukla, Alex Kentsis",Now published in Pediatric Blood and Cancer. 2016,"Background: Pediatric oncologists have begun to leverage tumor genetic profiling to match patients with targeted therapies. At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations. 
Procedure: This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine.
Results: There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), 8 (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4).
Conclusions: The MSKCC PMTB enabled a clinically relevant interpretation of genomic profiling. Effective use of clinical genomics is anticipated to require new and improved tools to ascribe pathogenic significance and therapeutic actionability.

Phytoplankton functional types: A trait perspective,"Andrew J. Irwin, Zoe Finkel",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Phytoplankton functional types are groupings of many species into a smaller number of types according to their ecological or biogeochemical role. Models describe phytoplankton functional types by a set of traits that determine their growth rates or fitness. Traits for functional types are often determined from observations on a small number of species under laboratory conditions. Functional types can be composed of a large number of species with very different trait values, so the representation of a type by an average trait value may not be appropriate. A potential solution is to estimate trait values from observations of the aggregate biomass of phytoplankton functional types in natural populations.

Accurate De Novo Prediction of Protein Contact Map by Ultra-Deep Learning Model,"Sheng Wang, Siqi Sun, Zhen Li, Renyu Zhang, Jinbo Xu",Now published in PLOS Computational Biology. 2016,"Motivation: Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction. 

Method: This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as long-range interdependency between contacts and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction. 

Results: Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on the 105 CASP11 targets, 76 CAMEO test proteins and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (especially for membrane proteins). Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore>0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we train our prediction models with only non-membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our method successfully folded one mainly-beta protein of 182 residues, one alpha+beta protein of 125 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 140 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 217 residues and one alpha+beta protein of 260 residues, all of which have a novel fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",['jinboxu@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/28/073239,biorxiv,2016,9cbc8d95-a30d-412d-b43e-ce71ab176c73,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/28/073239.full.pdf

Increased locomotor speed in head-fixed mice was associated with earlier onset of learning and trial-by-trial enhancement of learned responses. The influence of locomotion on conditioned responses was dissociable from changes in arousal and was independent of the sensory modality of the conditioned stimulus. Eyelid responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber terminals within the cerebellar cortex, but not at sites downstream, were also positively modulated by ongoing locomotion. We conclude that locomotor activity modulates delay eyeblink conditioning through mechanisms acting on the mossy fiber pathway within the cerebellar cortex.

Due to this combinatorial nature, obtaining the exhaustive set of full-length transcripts for a given species is a never-ending endeavor. Yet, each RNA deep sequencing experiment produces a variety of transcripts that depart from the reference transcriptome and should be properly identified. To address this challenge, we introduce a k-mer-based software protocol for capturing local RNA variation from a set of standard RNA-seq libraries, independently of a reference genome or transcriptome. Our software, called DE-kupl, analyzes k-mer contents and detects k-mers with differential abundance directly from the raw data files, prior to assembly or mapping. This enables to retrieve the virtually complete set of unannotated variation lying in an RNA-seq dataset. This variation is subsequently assigned to biological events such as differential lincRNAs, antisense RNAs, splice and polyadenylation variants, introns, expressed repeats, and SNV-harboring or exogenous RNA. We applied DE-kupl to public RNA-seq datasets, including an Epythelial-Mensenchymal Transition model and different human tissues. DE-kupl identified abundant novel events and showed excellent reproducibility when applied to independent deep sequencing experiments.

If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition system's optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data.

Relevance learning via inhibitory plasticity and its implications for schizophrenia,"Nathan Insel, Blake Richards",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions to cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which inputs are relevant and which irrelevant. Here, we develop an abstract but biologically plausible neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes expected magnitude of reward or punishment (""relevance""), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feed-forward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. The model exhibits learned irrelevance and blocking, which become impaired following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer, the relevance code is capable of modulating learning and activity. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.","['blake.richards@utoronto.ca', 'nathan.insel@umontana.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/161331,biorxiv,2017,af791b44-409e-40f6-9689-48133c98aacd,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/161331.full.pdf

Here we develop a splice-site-centric quantification method, allowing us to characterize transcriptome-wide alternative splicing with a simple probabilistic model, enabling species-wide comparison. We use information theory to quantify the coding potential gain and show that an increase in alternative splicing probability contributes more to transcriptome expansion than exon-count.

This rhythm is present in rodents where it is continuously evident during movement at frequencies within 6-12Hz [8,9]. In humans, however, the presence of continuous theta rhythm has been elusive; indeed, a functionally similar theta is thought to occur at lower frequency ranges (3-7Hz) and in shorter bouts [10-12]. This lower frequency theta rhythm is observed during a variety of behaviors, including virtual navigation, but has never been tested during real world ambulatory movement. Here we examined the oscillatory properties of theta within the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) in freely moving human subjects chronically implanted with the clinical NeuroPace RNS responsive neurostimulator device, capable of wireless recordings of continuous intracranial deep brain electroencephalographic (iEEG) activity. MTL iEEG recordings, together with sub-millimeter position tracking, revealed the presence of high frequency theta oscillations (6-12Hz) during ambulation. The prevalence of these oscillations was increased during fast movement compared to slow movement. These theta bouts, although occurring more frequently, were not significantly different in durations during fast versus slow movements. In a rare opportunity to study one subject with congenital blindness, we found that both the prevalence and duration of theta bouts were much greater than those in sighted subjects. Our results suggest that higher frequency theta indeed exists in humans during movement providing critical support for conserved neurobiological mechanisms for spatial navigation.

Fixed versus mixed RSA: Explaining visual representations by fixed and mixed feature sets from shallow and deep computational models," View ORCID ProfileSeyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi, Linda Henriksson, Kendrick Kay, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",Now published in Journal of Mathematical Psychology. 2016,"Studies of the primate visual system have begun to test a wide range of complex computational object-vision models. Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e.g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear representational features appropriate for the task (e.g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the representational feature space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical area's representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network, and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas.

Identification of splice junctions through RNA-seq is by mapping short reads to the reference genome which is prone to errors due to random sequence matches. This encourages identification of splicing junctions through computational methods based on machine learning. Existing models are dependent on feature extraction and selection for capturing splicing signals lying in vicinity of splice junctions. But such manually extracted features are not exhaustive.  Methods: We introduce distributed feature representation, SpliceVec, to avoid explicit and biased feature extraction generally adopted for such tasks.

Learned feature representation in form of SpliceVec is fed to multilayer perceptron for splice junction classification task.  Results: An intrinsic evaluation of SpliceVec indicates that it is able to group true and false sites distinctly. Our study on optimal context to be considered for feature extraction indicates inclusion of entire intronic sequence is better than flanking upstream and downstream region around splice junctions.

Dick,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2015,"In developing embryos of eukaryotes, varying concentrations and/or duration of exposure to morphogens induce and repress transcription factors (TFs) in a regular order, thereby acting as signals for cell differentiation. I present a chemical thermodynamic model for the formation and degradation of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the major TFs involved in dorsal-ventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube. This two-stage model first considers introduction of Shh into a chemically defined (oxidizing) environment. As the system is driven away from metastable equilibrium, the TFs progressively become more stable than Shh, as indicated by comparison of the calculated overall energies of formation (chemical affinity). In the second stage, a gradual return to metastable equilibrium with Shh drives transitions in the relative stabilities of the TFs that follow the experimental patterns of TF expression. At the intracellular level, the major proteins in the signal transduction network show a metastability progression among reactions of Shh and its cell-surface receptor and the intracellular Gli proteins that act as activators and repressors of transcription. If the endocytosis and degradation of receptor-ligand complexes are coupled to localized protein translation, the consequent thermodynamic constraints may represent a high-level source of specificity that coexists with molecular mechanisms of signal transduction.",['j3ffdick@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/01/015826,biorxiv,2015,60e8a669-af02-44b0-9fad-17d326051eaa,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/01/015826.full.pdf
Assessing Pathogens for Natural versus Laboratory Origins Using Genomic Data and Machine Learning,"Tonia Korves, Christopher D Garay, Heather A Carleton, Ashley Sabol, Eija Trees, Matthew W Peterson",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Pathogen genomic data is increasingly important in investigations of infectious disease outbreaks. The objective of this study is to develop methods for using large-scale genomic data to determine the type of the environment an outbreak pathogen came from. Specifically, this study focuses on assessing whether an outbreak strain came from a natural environment or experienced substantial laboratory culturing. The approach uses phylogenetic analyses and machine learning to identify DNA changes that are characteristic of laboratory culturing. The analysis methods include parallelized sequence read alignment, variant identification, phylogenetic tree construction, ancestral state reconstruction, semi-supervised classification, and random forests. These methods were applied to 902 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genomes from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database. The analyses identified candidate signatures of laboratory culturing that are highly consistent with genes identified in published laboratory passage studies. In particular, the analysis identified mutations in rpoS, hfq, rfb genes, acrB, and rbsR as strong signatures of laboratory culturing. In leave-one-out cross-validation, the classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89 for strains from two laboratory reference sets collected in the 1940s and 1980s.  The classifier was also used to assess laboratory culturing in foodborne and laboratory acquired outbreak strains closely related to laboratory reference strain serovar Typhimurium 14028.  The classifier detected some evidence of laboratory culturing on the phylogeny branch leading to this clade, suggesting all of these strains may have a common ancestor that experienced laboratory culturing. Together, these results suggest that phylogenetic analysis and machine learning could be used to assess whether pathogens collected from patients are naturally occurring or have been extensively cultured in laboratories. The data analysis methods can be applied to any bacterial pathogen species, and could be adapted to assess viral pathogens and other types of source environments.",['tkorves@mitre.org'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/06/079541,biorxiv,2016,22ee4253-e6f3-432f-996a-5f131339def8,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/06/079541.full.pdf

and confounded by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to fairly quantify
and compare correlations and we propose a novel measure of correlation ? the Spike
Time Tiling Coefficient. This coefficient, the correlation index and 33 other measures
of correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required properties on synthetic

This manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage ""triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit"" approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or ""collided"" events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a ""coreset"" approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a  Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The ""triaged"" waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data.

Health Information Needs and Health Seeking Behavior during the 2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak: A Twitter Content Analysis,"Michelle Odlum, Sunmoo Yoon",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Introduction. For effective public communication during major disease outbreaks like the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, health information needs of the population must be adequately assessed. Through content analysis of social media data, like tweets, public health information needs can be effectively assessed and in turn provide appropriate health information to effectively address such needs. The aim of the current study was to assess health information needs about Ebola, at distinct epidemic time points, through longitudinal tracking. 

Methods. Natural language processing was applied to explore public response to Ebola over time from the beginning of the outbreak (July 2014) to six month post outbreak (March 2015). A total 155,647 tweets (unique 68,736, retweet 86,911) mentioning Ebola were analyzed and visualized with infographics. 

Results. Public fear, frustration, and health information seeking regarding Ebola-related global priorities were observed across time. Our longitudinal content analysis revealed that due to ongoing health information deficiencies, resulting in fear and frustration, social media was at times an impediment and not a vehicle to support health information needs.

In several species, MKS and NPHP proteins form separate complexes that cooperate with Cep290 to assemble the TZ, but flies lack an
obvious NPHP complex. We show that MKS proteins in flies are spatially separated from Cep290 at the TZ, and that flies mutant for individual MKS
genes fail to recruit other MKS proteins to the TZ, while Cep290 appears to be recruited  normally. Although there are abnormalities in microtubule and membrane organisation in developing MKS mutant cilia, these defects are
less apparent in adults, where sensory cilia and sperm flagella function quite normally. Thus, surprisingly, MKS proteins are not essential for cilia or flagella function in flies.","['jordan.raff@path.ox.ac.uk', 'helio.roque@path.ox.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/10/058081,biorxiv,2016,03dcba02-b9fc-41e1-a910-b406e80f60bf,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/10/058081.full.pdf
Minor allele frequency thresholds strongly affect population structure inference with genomic datasets," View ORCID ProfileEthan B. Linck, C. J. Battey",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Across the genome, the effects of different evolutionary processes and historical events can result in different classes of genetic variants (or alleles) characterized by their relative frequency in a given population. As a result, population genetic inference can be strongly affected by biases in laboratory and bioinformatics treatments that affect the site frequency spectrum, or SFS. Yet despite the widespread use of reduced-representation genomic datasets with nonmodel organisms, the potential consequences of these biases for downstream analyses remain poorly examined. Here, we assess the influence of minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds implemented during variant detection on inference of population structure. We use simulated and empirical datasets to evaluate the effect of MAF thresholds on the ability to discriminate among populations and quantify admixture with both model-based and non-model-based clustering methods. We find model-based inference of population structure is highly sensitive to choice of MAF, and may be confounded by either including singletons or excluding all rare alleles. In contrast, non-model-based clustering is largely robust to MAF choice. Our results suggest that model-based inference of population structure can fail due to either natural demographic processes or assembly artifacts, with broad consequences for phylogeographic and population genetic studies using NGS data.

TITER: predicting translation initiation sites by deep learning,"Sai Zhang, Hailin Hu, Tao Jiang, Lei Zhang, Jianyang Zeng",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2017,"Motivation: Translation initiation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g., GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.
Methods: We have developed a deep learning based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework.
Results: Extensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.","['lzhang20@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn', 'zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn', 'journals.permissions@oup.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/103374,biorxiv,2017,103ae61b-df1b-4949-b159-92aab3d7edf0,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/12/103374.full.pdf

Beta-Band Oscillations without Pathways: the opposing Roles of D2 and D5 Receptors,"Jean F. Lienard, Ignasi Cos, Benoit Girard",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong Beta-band oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. According to the mainstream theory, this synchrony is mediated by a dopamine deficit within the striatum creating a functional imbalance between the D1-expressing medium spiny neurons, which project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, and D2-expressing one, which target its external segment, and ultimately leads to oscillatory activity. However, anatomical evidence gathered in rodents and primates has shown that striatal neurons are for the most part not organized into independent populations differentially targeting the two segments of the globus pallidus, nor alternatively expressing D1 or D2 receptors, thus calling for an alternative mechanism through which the lack of dopamine may cause oscillations. Here we adopt a computational approach in which we investigate a model whose parameters are fit to an extensive set of anatomical and physiological constraints from non-human primates, including axonal transmission delays gathered from eight experimental studies. Investigating the lack of dopamine in this model revealed that in the absence of
segregated pathways, Beta-band oscillations emerge as a consequence of the extra-striate dopaminergic receptors reduced activity. These oscillations are caused by synchronous activity within the external globus pallidus-subthalamic nucleus loop, and their frequency are modulated by the transmission delays between these nuclei. Our model delivers a parsimonious explanation of oscillations that does not require any external driving influence from cortex, nor specific medium spiny neuron properties.",['jean.f.lienard@gmail.com'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/161661,biorxiv,2017,b1ac6f5f-3ba6-4879-96eb-72fc6b60c5cd,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/161661.full.pdf

The current study analyzes their modes of association, in terms of networks, both within globular proteins and also at protein-protein interfaces. Apart from the most common and trivial case of isolated salt-bridges, bifurcated salt-bridges appear to be a special salt-bridge motif both in terms of its topology and geometry and found ubiquitously in proteins and inter-protein complexes. Interesting and attractive examples presenting different interaction-modes have been highlighted. Bifurcated salt-bridges appear to function as molecular clips instrumental in stitching large surface contours of interacting protein-protein interfaces. The work also emphasizes the key role of salt-bridge mediated interactions in the partial folding of proteins containing large amount of disordered regions. Salt-bridge mediated interactions seem pivotal in promoting ‘disorder-to-order’ transitions for small disordered protein fragments and their stabilization upon binding. The results should guide to elucidate the modus operandi of these partially disordered proteins and also should be helpful to conceptualize how these proteins manage to keep necessary amount of disorder even in their functionally active bound forms, encouraging future studies.

Reveel: large-scale population genotyping using low-coverage sequencing data,"Lin Huang, Bo Wang, Ruitang Chen, Sivan Bercovici, Serafim Batzoglou",Now published in Bioinformatics. 2014,"Population low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic variation and genotyping a cohort. This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele-frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises when attempting to discover variants and genotype the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in cases where low-coverage population data are given, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical. Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging linkage disequilibrium that deviates from previous Markov-based models.

Deconvolution Of Subcellular Protrusion Heterogeneity And The Underlying Actin Regulator Dynamics From Live Cell Imaging,"Chuangqi Wang, Hee June Choi, Sung-Jin Kim, Yongho Bae, Kwonmoo Lee",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Cell protrusion is morphodynamically heterogeneous at the subcellular level. However, the mechanistic understanding of protrusion activities is usually based on the ensemble average of actin regulator dynamics at the cellular or population levels. Here, we establish a machine learning-based computational framework called HACKS (deconvolution of Heterogeneous Activity Coordination in cytosKeleton at a Subcellular level) to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of lamellipodial protrusion. HACKS identifies distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes hidden in highly heterogeneous protrusion activities and reveals their underlying actin regulator dynamics. The association between each protrusion phenotype and the actin regulator dynamics is further corroborated by predicting the protrusion phenotype based on actin regulator dynamics. Using our method, we discovered the hidden rare ‘accelerating’ protrusion phenotype in addition to ‘fluctuating’ and ‘periodic’ protrusions. Intriguingly, the accelerating protrusion was driven predominantly by VASP-mediated actin elongation rather than by Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation. Our analyses also suggested that VASP controls protrusion velocity more directly than Arp2/3 complex, thereby playing a significant role in the accelerating protrusion phenotype.

We took a generalized linear modeling approach to extract fine spike timing (FST) characteristics and related these to place cell fidelity used as a surrogate of spatial cognition. We find that MCDs disrupt FST and place-modulated rate coding in hippocampal CA1 and that EE restores both to normal. Moreover, FST parameters predict spatial coherence of neurons, suggesting that mechanisms determining FST are critical for cognition.

"The fishing and natural mortality of large, piscivorous Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake, British Columbia (2008-2013)","Joseph Thorley, Greg Andrusak",Now published in PeerJ. 2016,"Background. Estimates of fishing and natural mortality are important for understanding, and ultimately managing, commercial and recreational fisheries. High reward tags with fixed station acoustic telemetry provides a promising approach to monitoring mortality rates in large lake recreational fisheries. Kootenay Lake is a large lake which supports an important recreational fishery for large Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout.

Methods. Between 2008 and 2013, 88 large (≥ 500 mm) Bull Trout and 149 large (≥ 500 mm) Rainbow Trout were marked with an acoustic transmitter and/or high reward ($100) anchor tags in Kootenay Lake. The subsequent detections and angler recaptures were analysed using a Bayesian individual state-space Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) survival model with indicator variable selection.

Results. The final CJS survival model estimated that the annual interval probability of being recaptured by an angler was 0.17 (95% CRI 0.11 - 0.23) for Bull Trout and 0.14 (95% CRI 0.09 - 0.19) for Rainbow Trout. The annual interval survival probability for Bull Trout was estimated to have declined from 0.91 (95% CRI 0.77 - 0.97) in 2009 to just 0.45 (95% CRI 0.24 - 0.73) in 2013. Rainbow Trout survival was most strongly affected by spawning. The annual interval survival probability was 0.77 (95% CRI 0.68 - 0.85) for a non-spawning Rainbow Trout compared to 0.42 (95% CRI 0.31 - 0.54) for a spawner. The probability of spawning increased with the fork length for both species and decreased over the course of the study for Rainbow Trout.

Discussion. Fishing mortality was relatively low and constant while natural mortality was relatively high and variable. The results are consistent with Kokanee abundance as opposed to angler effort as the primary driver of short-term population fluctations in Rainbow Trout abundance. Multi-species stock assessment models need to account for the fact that large Bull Trout are more abundant than large Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/08/068387,biorxiv,2016,c291adcf-6ac9-48ed-b035-9e55d0eca377,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/08/068387.full.pdf

Davis,  View ORCID ProfileLaurence Loewe",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Biological model curation provides new insights by integrating biological knowledge-fragments, assessing their uncertainty, and analyzing the reliability of potential interpretations. Here we integrate published results about circadian clocks in Drosophila melanogaster while exploring economies of scale in biological model curation. Clocks govern rhythms of gene-expression that impact fitness, health, cancer, memory, mental functions, and more. Human clock insights have been repeatedly pioneered in flies. Flies simplify investigating complex gene regulatory networks, which express proteins cyclically using environmentally entrained interlocking feedback loops that act as clocks. Simulations could simplify research further. We found that very few computational models test their quality directly against experimentally observed time series scattered in the literature. We designed FlyClockbase for integrating such scattered data to enable robust efficient access for biologists and modelers. To this end we have been defining data structures that simplify the construction and maintenance of Versioned Biological Information Resources (VBIRs) that prioritize simplicity, openness, and therefore maintainability. We aim to simplify the preservation of more raw data and relevant annotations from experiments in order to multiply the long-term value of wet-lab datasets for modelers interested in meta-analyses, parameter estimates, and hypothesis testing. Currently FlyClockbase contains over 400 wildtype time series of core circadian components systematically curated from 86 studies published between 1990 and 2015. Using FlyClockbase, we show that PERIOD protein amount peak time variance unexpectedly exceeds that of TIMELESS. We hypothesize that PERIOD's exceedingly more complex phosphorylation rules are responsible. Variances of daily event times are easily confounded by errors. We improved result reliability by a human error analysis of our data handling; this revealed significance-degrading outliers, possibly violating a presumed absence of wildtype heterogeneity or lab evolution. Separate analyses revealed elevated stochasticity in PCR-based peak time variances; yet our reported core difference in peak time variances appears robust. Our study demonstrates how biological model curation enhances the understanding of circadian clocks. It also highlights diverse broader challenges that are likely to become recurrent themes if models in molecular systems biology aim to integrate 'all relevant knowledge'. We developed a trans-disciplinary workflow, which demonstrates the importance of developing compilers for VBIRs with a more biology-friendly logic that is likely to greatly simplify biological model curation.

Forero, Bangfu Zhu, Marta Moreira, Mark Phizacklea, Graham McIlroy, Nicholas J.

Paradoxically, truncated Trk isoforms lacking the TyrK predominate in the adult human brain, but whether they have neuronal functions independently of full-length Trks is unknown. Drosophila has TyrK-less Trk-family receptors, encoded by the kekkon (Kek) genes, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved functions for this receptor class may exist. Here, we asked whether Keks function together with Drosophila neurotrophins (DNTs) at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Starting with an unbiased approach, we tested the eleven LRR and Ig-containing (LIG) proteins encoded in the Drosophila genome for expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and potential interaction with DNTs. Kek-6 was expressed in the CNS, could rescue the cold semi-lethality of DNT1 DNT2 double mutants and could bind DNT2 both in signaling assays and in co-immunoprecipitations. There is promiscuity in ligand binding, as Kek-6 could also bind DNT1, and Kek-5 could also bind DNT2. In vivo, Kek-6 is found presynaptically in motoneurons, and binds DNT2 produced by the muscle, which functions as a retrograde factor at the NMJ. Kek-6 and DNT2 regulate NMJ growth, bouton formation and active zone homeostasis. Kek-6 does not antagonise the alternative DNT2 receptor Toll-6, but rather the two receptors contribute in distinct manners to NMJ structural plasticity. Using pull-down assays, we identified and validated CaMKII and VAP33A as intracellular partners of Kek-6, and show that together they regulate structural synaptic plasticity. These functions of Kek-6 could be evolutionarily conserved, raising the intriguing possibility that a novel mechanism of structural synaptic plasticity involving truncated Trk-family receptors independently of TyrK signaling may also operate in the human brain.",['a.hidalgo@bham.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/124644,biorxiv,2017,97637568-1a87-459f-b064-acb85f20b3b9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/124644.full.pdf

This information was reduced to a collection of 112 characteristic Pfam protein domains and a list of complete-sequenced sulfur genomes. Using the mathematical framework of relative entropy (H), we quantitatively measured the enrichment of these domains among sulfur genomes.

Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm to accurately classify (AUC=0.985) hard to culture genomes (e.g., Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator), previously characterized ones and metagenomic environments such as hydrothermal vents, or deep-sea sediment.

Gappy TotalReCaller for RNASeq Base-Calling and Mapping,Bud (Bhubaneswar) Mishra,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2013,"Understanding complex mammalian biology depends crucially on our ability to define a precise map of all the transcripts encoded in a genome, and to measure their relative abundances. A promising assay depends on RNASeq approaches, which builds on next generation sequencing pipelines capable of interrogating cDNAs extracted from a cell. The underlying pipeline starts with base-calling, collect the sequence reads and interpret the raw-read in terms of transcripts that are grouped with respect to different splice-variant isoforms of a messenger RNA. We address a very basic problem involved in all of these pipeline, namely accurate Bayesian base-calling, which could combine the analog intensity data with suitable underlying priors on base-composition in the transcripts. In the context of sequencing genomic DNA, a powerful approach for base-calling has been developed in the TotalReCaller pipeline. For these purposes, it uses a suitable reference whole-genome sequence in a compressed self-indexed format to derive its priors. However, TotalReCaller faces many new challenges in the transcriptomic domain, especially since we still lack a fully annotated library of all possible transcripts, and hence a sufficiently good prior. There are many possible solutions, similar to the ones developed for TotalReCaller, in applications addressing de novo sequencing and assembly, where partial contigs or string-graphs could be used to boot-strap the Bayesian priors on base-composition. A similar approach would be applicable here too, partial assembly of transcripts can be used to characterize the splicing junctions or organize them in incom- patibility graphs and then used as priors for TotalReCaller. The key algorithmic techniques for this purpose have been addressed in a forthcoming paper on Stringomics. Here, we address a related but fundamental problem, by assuming that we only have a reference genome, with certain intervals marked as candidate regions for ORF (Open Reading Frames), but not necessarily complete annotations regarding the 5 or 3 termini of a gene or its exon-intron structure. The algorithms we describe find the most accurate base-calls of a cDNA with the best possible segmentation, all mapped to the genome appropriately.",['mishra@nyu.edu.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/11/15/000489,biorxiv,2013,f810035a-a0dc-42a9-ab66-a79948e6b5bb,0,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/11/15/000489.full.pdf
Basal Ganglia Control Of Reflexive Saccades: A Computational Model Integrating Physiology Anatomy And Behaviour,"Alexander Cope, Jonathan M. Chambers, Tony J. Prescott, Kevin N. Gurney",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"It is hypothesised that the basal ganglia play a key role in solving the problem of action selection. Here we investigate this hypothesis through computational modelling of the primate saccadic oculomotor system. This system is an excellent target for computational modelling because it is supported by a reasonably well understood functional anatomy, has limited degrees of freedom, and there is a wealth of behavioural and electrophysiological data for model comparison. Here, we describe a computational model of the reflexive saccadic oculomotor system incorporating the basal ganglia, key structures in motor control and competition between possible actions. To restrict the likelihood of overfitting the model it is structured and parameterised by the known anatomy and neurophysiology along with data from a single experimental behavioural paradigm, then validated by testing against several additional behavioural experimental data without modification of the parameters. With this model we reproduce a range of fundamental reflexive saccadic results both qualitatively and quantitatively, comprising: the distribution of saccadic latencies; the effect of eccentricity, luminance and fixation-target interactions on saccadic latencies; and the effect of competing targets on saccadic endpoint. By investigating the model dynamics we are able to provide mechanistic explanations for the sources of these behaviours. Further, because of its accesibility, the oculomotor system has also been used to study general principle of sensorimotor control. We interpret the ability of the basal ganglia to successfully control saccade selection in our model as further evidence for the action selection hypothesis.",['a.cope@sheffield.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/08/135251,biorxiv,2017,da68ca82-a5ae-4ba5-885c-051a59f52bfc,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/08/135251.full.pdf
Predicting Protein Binding Affinity With Word Embeddings And Recurrent Neural Networks,Carlo Mazzaferro,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"At the core of our immunological system lies a group of proteins named Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), to which epitopes (also proteins sometimes named antigenic determinants), bind to eliciting a response. These responses are extremely varied and of widely different nature. For instance, Killer and Helper T cells are responsible for, respectively, counteracting viral pathogens and tumorous cells. Many other types exist, but their underlying structure can be very similar due to the fact that they all are proteins and bind to the MHC receptor in a similar fashion. With this framework in mind, being able to predict with precision the structure of a protein that will elicit a specific response in the human body represents a novel computational approach to drug discovery. Although many machine learning approaches have been used, no attempt to solve this problem using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) exist.

ChIP-seq is the omics technique that enables genome wide localization of transcription factor binding or epigenetic modification events. Since the inception of ChIP-seq in 2007, many methods have been developed to infer ChIP target binding loci from the resultant reads after mapping them to a reference genome.  However, interpreting these data has proven challenging, and as such these algorithms have several shortcomings, including susceptibility to false positives due to artifactual peaks, poor localization of binding sites, and the requirement for a total DNA input control which increases the cost of performing these experiments. We present Ritornello, a new approach with roots in digital signal processing (DSP) that addresses all of these problems. We show that Ritornello generally performs equally or better than the peak callers tested and recommended by the ENCODE consortium, but in contrast, Ritornello does not require a matched total DNA input control to avoid false positives, effectively decreasing the sequencing cost to perform ChIP-seq.",['yuval.kluger@yale.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/11/034090,biorxiv,2015,3b8772d5-c5ff-437d-9186-cb9527c28694,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/11/034090.full.pdf

Here, we selectively activated THVTA neurons in transgenic rats and measured resulting changes in whole-brain activity using stimulus-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Selective optogenetic stimulation of THVTA neurons not only enhanced cerebral blood volume (CBV) signals in striatal target regions in a dopamine receptor dependent fashion, but also engaged many additional anatomically defined regions throughout the brain. In addition, repeated pairing of THVTA neuronal activity with forepaw stimulation, produced an expanded brain-wide sensory representation. These data suggest that modulation of THVTA neurons can impact brain dynamics across many distributed anatomically distinct regions, even those that receive little to no direct THVTA input.","['gstuber@med.unc.edu', 'shihy@unc.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/02/042168,biorxiv,2016,30279524-8408-4563-a0e4-a77a56281d37,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/02/042168.full.pdf

The coevolutionary romance of social learning and parasitic behavior,Richard McElreath,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Once an animal begins to acquire behavior by social learning, it may be seduced by parasitic behavior, behavior that reduces the animal's fitness and thereby increases its own spread. However, the animal's psychology will coevolve, potentially limiting the influence and spread of parasitic behavior. I revisit prominent models of the evolution of social learning and introduce the possibility of parasitic behavior. First, I explore a courtship between primitive social learning and parasitic behavior. Parasitic behavior can spread, but selection on the host then reduces social learning and limits its importance. Both parties are frustrated. In the second part, I study a reconciliation dynamic in which social learning becomes strategic about who it partners with. In this model, parasitic behavior can become prevalent and substantially reduce host fitness. However, it may also evolve to be mutualistic and raise the mean fitness of the host organism. When this occurs, natural selection may favor psychological susceptibility to parasitic behavior. Both social learning and socially learned behavior can enjoy a happy ending.",['richard_mcelreath@eva.mpg.de.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/30/055889,biorxiv,2016,6fe45a7f-5c36-4083-96ac-36bba9614071,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/30/055889.full.pdf

Several proposed functions assume that sensory experience can influence subsequent spontaneous activity. However, long-term alterations in spontaneous firing rates following sensory stimulation have not been reported until now. Here we show that multi-whisker, spatiotemporally rich stimulation of mouse vibrissae induces a laminar-specific, long-term increase of spontaneous activity in the somatosensory cortex. Such stimulation additionally produces stereotypical neural ensemble firing patterns from simultaneously recorded single neurons, which are maintained during spontaneous activity following stimulus offset. The increased neural activity and concomitant ensemble firing patterns are sustained for at least 25 minutes after stimulation, and specific to layers IV and Vb. In contrast, the same stimulation protocol applied to a single whisker fails to elicit this effect. Since layer Vb has the largest receptive fields and, together with layer IV, receives direct thalamic and lateral drive, the increase in firing activity could be the result of mechanisms involving the integration of spatiotemporal patterns across multiple whiskers. Our results provide direct evidence of modification of spontaneous cortical activity by sensory stimulation and could offer insight into the role of spatiotemporal integration in memory storage mechanisms for complex stimuli.","['s.schultz@imperial.ac.uk', 's.schultz@imperial.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/058958,biorxiv,2017,909cdfac-cd54-482b-9311-c5db608381e9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/058958.full.pdf

In the past few years, single cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the L2 stage, effectively 50-fold ""shotgun cellular coverage"" of the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and selective genes.

We identify intron retention (IR) as the predominant splicing change affecting early stages of wild-type neural differentiation, targeting key genes involved in the splicing machinery. Importantly, IR occurs prematurely in VCP-mutant cultures compared with control counterparts; these events are also observed in independent RNAseq datasets from SOD1- and FUS-mutant motor neurons (MNs). Together with related effects on 3'UTR length variation, these findings implicate alternative RNA-processing in regulating distinct stages of lineage restriction from iPSCs to MNs, and reveal a temporal deregulation of such processing by ALS mutations.

The resultant retroposon-based phylogeny provides a powerful and independent corroboration of previous indications derived from sequence-based analyses. Notably, SINE activity began in the common ancestor of Eupasseres (passerines excl. the New Zealand wrens Acanthisittidae) and ceased before the rapid diversification of oscine passerines (songbirds). Furthermore, we find evidence for very recent SINE activity within suboscine passerines, following the emergence of a SINE via acquisition of a different tRNA head as we suggest through template switching.

Predicting how and when hidden neurons skew measured synaptic interactions,"Braden A. W. Brinkman, Fred Rieke, Eric Shea-Brown, Michael A. Buice",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the “hidden” portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron r′ to a post-synaptic neuron r can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from r′ to r plus corrections from every directed path from r′ to r through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have—or do not have—major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons.  As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with “strong” coupling—connection weights that scale with 1/√N, where N is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.",['bradenb@uw.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/14/105510,biorxiv,2017,d8233395-4051-4976-af2f-13b3f71cafaa,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/14/105510.full.pdf
Between semelparity and iteroparity: empirical evidence for a continuum of modes of parity, View ORCID ProfileP. William Hughes,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The number of times an organism reproduces (i.e. its mode of parity) is a fundamental life-history character, and evolutionary and ecological models that compare the relative fitness of strategies are common in life history theory and theoretical biology. Despite the success of mathematical models designed to compare intrinsic rates of increase between annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous reproductive schedules, there is widespread evidence that variation in reproductive allocation among semelparous and iteroparous organisms alike is continuous. This paper reviews the ecological and molecular evidence for the continuity and plasticity of modes of parity--that is, the idea that annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous life histories are better understood as endpoints along a continuum of possible strategies. I conclude that parity should be understood as a continuum of different modes of parity, which differ by the degree to which they disperse or concentrate reproductive effort in time. I further argue that there are three main implications of this conclusion: (1) That seasonality should not be conflated with parity; (2) that mathematical models purporting to explain the evolution of semelparous life histories from iteroparous ones (or vice versa) should not assume that organisms can only display either an annual-semelparous life history or a perennial-iteroparous one; and (3) that evolutionary ecologists should examine the physiological or molecular basis of traits underlying different modes of parity, in order to obtain a general understanding of how different life history strategies can evolve from one another.",['whughes@mpipz.mpg.de'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/10/107268,biorxiv,2017,339becf5-6659-4e94-88f2-d166aafd1803,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/10/107268.full.pdf

Tumor Origin Detection with Tissue-Specific miRNA and DNA methylation Markers,"Wei Tang, Shixiang Wan, Quan Zou",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Motivation: Cancer of unknown primary origin constitutes 3-5% of all human malignancies. Pa-tients with these carcinomas present with metastases without an established primary site, which may not be found even by thorough histological search methods. Patients with cancer of unknown primary origin always have poor prognosis and hardly have efficient treatment since most cancers respond well to specific chemotherapy or hormone drugs. Many studies have proposed classifiers based on miRNAs or mRNAs to predict the tumor origins, but few study focus on high-dimensional DNA methylation profiles.
Results: We introduced three classifiers with novel feature selection algorithm combined with ran-dom forest to effectively identify highly tissue-specific epigenetics biomarkers such as microRNAs and CpG sites, which can help us predict the origin site of tumors. This algorithm, incorporating differential analysis and descending dimension algorithm, was applied on 14 histological tissues and over 5000 samples based on miRNA expression and DNA methylation profiles to assign given primary tumor to its origin tissue. Our study shows all of these three classifiers have an overall ac-curacy of 87.78% (72.55%-97.54%) based on miRNA datasets and an accuracy of 96.43% (MRMD: 87.85%-99.76%) or 97.06% (PCA: 92.44%-100%) based on DNA methylation datasets on predict-ing the origin of tumors and suggests that the biomarkers we selected can efficiently predict the origin of tumors and allow the clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less ag-gressive therapeutic options. We also developed a user-friendly webserver which enables users to predict the origin site of tumors by uploading the miRNAs expression or DNA methylation profiles of those cancers.

Here we present NanoJ-SQUIRREL, an ImageJ-based analytical approach providing a quantitative assessment of super-resolution image quality. By comparing diffraction-limited images and super-resolution equivalents of the same focal volume, this approach generates a quantitative map of super-resolution defects, as well as methods for their correction. To illustrate its broad applicability to super-resolution approaches we apply our method to Localization Microscopy, STED and SIM images of a variety of in-cell structures including microtubules, poxviruses, neuronal actin rings and clathrin coated pits. We particularly focus on single-molecule localisation microscopy, where super-resolution reconstructions often feature imperfections not present in the original data. By showing the quantitative evolution of data quality over these varied sample preparation, acquisition and super-resolution methods we display the potential of NanoJ-SQUIRREL to guide optimization of super-resolution imaging parameters.","['j.mercer@ucl.ac.uk', 'r.henriques@ucl.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/158279,biorxiv,2017,30848141-fba6-4435-8eb0-2f1c921db599,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/17/158279.full.pdf
Gene-Culture Coevolution of Prosocial Rituals,Karl Frost,Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"It has been argued that costly socially learned rituals have the potential to generate prosocial emotional responses arising from genetically based behavioral dispositions, hijacking these behavioral dispositions to solve otherwise intractable cooperation problems. An example is the innovation of synchronous movement rituals which seem to engage the same altruistic response as instinctual mimicry. Arguments against this hypothesis are based in the idea that cheap markers of altruistic intent (""Green Beards"")are vulnerable to manipulation from non-cooperating free-riders that are similarly marked. This paper formally models the gene-culture coevolutionary dynamics of a system in which a costly socially learned ritual practice coevolves with the genes underpinning the prosocial response. This takes a 'genetic mismatch' hypothesis (where fast evolution of socially learned behaviors create a temporary mismatch with the coevolving genes, which take longer to evolve to equilibrium) and models it dynamically. The genetic and cultural fitness equations are first analyzed for equilibrium and then simulations are used to predicting trajectories for both the socially learned behavior and the hijacked genetic trait over time. Relying on fast culture and slow genes, it demonstrates how high levels of ritual efficacy may be established, at least temporarily, through gene culture interaction. It also shows how longer term feedbacks on the genes from culture may lead to decreases in the prosocial gene in the population and reduced overall population mean fitness, despite high levels of altruism in the population.",['kjfrost@ucdavis.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/060632,biorxiv,2016,635c3330-eda8-4799-953a-73bb7f5031a1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/24/060632.full.pdf
RNA structure inference through chemical mapping after accidental or intentional mutations," View ORCID ProfileClarence Cheng, Wipapat Kladwang, Joseph Yesselman,  View ORCID ProfileRhiju Das",Now published in PNAS. 2017,"Despite the critical roles RNA structures play in regulating gene expression, sequencing-based methods for experimentally determining RNA base pairs have remained inaccurate.  Here, we describe a multidimensional chemical mapping method called M2-seq (mutate-and-map read out through next-generation sequencing) that takes advantage of sparsely mutated nucleotides to induce structural perturbations at partner nucleotides and then detects these events through dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing and mutational profiling. In special cases, fortuitous errors introduced during DNA template preparation and RNA transcription are sufficient to give M2-seq helix signatures; these signals were previously overlooked or mistaken for correlated double DMS events. When mutations are enhanced through error-prone PCR, in vitro M2-seq experimentally resolves 33 of 68 helices in diverse structured RNAs including ribozyme domains, riboswitch aptamers, and viral RNA domains with a single false positive.

Separable Fully Connected Layers Improve Deep Learning Models For Genomics," View ORCID ProfileAmr Mohamed Alexandari, Avanti Shrikumar, Anshul Kundaje",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.

We examine the benefits of using prior system knowledge and investigate how learning accuracy depends on various system parameters as well as the amount of training data available. The simulations are based on Boolean networks--directed graphs with 0/1 node states and logical node update rules--which are the simplest computational systems that can mimic the dynamic behavior of cellular systems. Boolean networks can be generated and simulated at scale, have complex yet cyclical dynamics, and as such provide a useful framework for developing machine learning algorithms for modular and hierarchical networks such as biological systems in general and cancer in particular.

Repeated replacement of an intrabacterial symbiont in the tripartite nested mealybug symbiosis,"Filip Husnik, John P McCutcheon",Now published in PNAS. 2016,"Stable endosymbiosis of a bacterium into a host cell promotes cellular and genomic complexity. The mealybug Planococcus citri has two bacterial endosymbionts; remarkably, the gammaproteobacterium Moranella endobia lives in the cytoplasm of the betaproteobacterium Tremblaya princeps. These two bacteria, along with genes horizontally transferred from other bacteria to the P. citri genome, encode complementary gene sets that form a complex metabolic patchwork.  Here we test the stability of this three-way symbiosis by sequencing host-symbiont genome pairs for five diverse mealybug species. We find marked fluidity over evolutionary time: while Tremblaya is the result of a single infection in the ancestor of mealybugs, the innermost gammaproteobacterial symbionts result from multiple replacements of inferred different ages from related but distinct bacterial lineages. Our data show that symbiont replacement can happen even in the most intricate symbiotic arrangements, and that pre-existing horizontally transferred genes can remain stable on genomes in the face of extensive symbiont turnover.","['filip.husnik@gmail.com', 'john.mccutcheon@umontana.edu.']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/03/042267,biorxiv,2016,9566f7c5-a8fe-4f23-85f7-bd60a8a8c1b4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/03/042267.full.pdf
"T1 white/gray contrast as a predictor of chronological age, and an index of cognitive performance","John D Lewis, Alan C Evans, Jussi Tohka",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"The maturational schedule of human brain development appears to be narrowly confined.  The chronological age of an individual can be predicted from brain images with considerable accuracy, and deviation from the typical pattern of brain maturation has been related to cognitive performance. Methods using multi-modal data, or complex measures derived from voxels throughout the brain have shown the greatest accuracy, but are difficult to interpret in terms of the biology.  Measures based on the cortical surface(s) have yielded less accurate predictions, suggesting that perhaps developmental changes related to cortical gray matter are not strongly related to chronological age, and that perhaps development is more strongly related to changes in subcortical regions or in deep white matter. We show that a simple metric based on the white/gray contrast at the inner border of the cortical gray-matter is a comparably good predictor of chronological age, and our usage of an elastic net penalized linear regression model reveals the brain regions which contribute most to age-prediction.  We demonstrate this in two large datasets: the NIH Pediatric Data, with 832 scans of typically developing children, adolescents, and young adults; and the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics data, with 760 scans of individuals in a similar age-range.  Moreover, we show that the residuals of age-prediction based on this white/gray contrast metric are more strongly related to IQ than are those from cortical thickness, suggesting that this metric is more sensitive to aspects of brain development that reflect cognitive performance.","['jlewis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca', 'jussi.tohka@uef.', 'jlewis@bic.mni.mcgill.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/03/171892,biorxiv,2017,ac61eee8-c01f-4470-b302-dc2fb3818bc1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/03/171892.full.pdf

However, to what extent immunoediting is shaping the cancer genome is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the impact of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers on modulating immunoediting remains largely unexplored. Here we elucidated the impact of evolutionary and immune-related forces on editing the tumor in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). We first show that MC38 cell line is a valid model for hypermutated and microsatellite-unstable (MSI) CRC. Analyses of longitudinal samples of wild type and immunodeficient RAG1 knockout mice transplanted with MC38 cells revealed that upregulation of checkpoint molecules and infiltration of Tregs are the major tumor escape mechanisms. Strikingly, the impact of neutral evolution on sculpting the tumor outweighed immunoediting. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway potentiated immunoediting and rendered tumors more homogeneous in the MC38 model. The immunoediting effects were less pronounced in a nonhypermutated/MSI- model CT26.

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loci in different compartments that had been in the same loop domain become more segregated. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation, but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes, and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. Cohesin restoration quickly reverses these effects, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid.","['erez@erez.com', 'erez@erez.com']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139782,biorxiv,2017,5b2913c1-aa48-4457-9a24-4b1209cc97c2,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/139782.full.pdf
Olfactory coding in the turbulent realm,"Vincent Jacob, Christelle Monsempes,  View ORCID ProfileJean-Pierre Rospars, Jean-Baptiste Masson,  View ORCID ProfilePhilippe Lucas",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Long-distance olfactory search behaviors depend on odor detection dynamics. Due to turbulence, olfactory signals travel as bursts of variable concentration and spacing and are characterized by long-tail distributions of odor/no-odor events, challenging the computing capacities of olfactory systems. How animals encode complex olfactory scenes to track the plume far from the source remains unclear. Here we focus on the coding of the plume temporal dynamics in moths. We compare responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) to sequences of pheromone stimuli either with white-noise patterns or with realistic turbulent temporal structures simulating a large range of distances (8 to 64 m) from the odor source. For the first time, we analyze what information is extracted by the olfactory system at large distances from the source. Neuronal responses are analyzed using linear-nonlinear models fitted with white-noise stimuli and used for predicting responses to turbulent stimuli. We found that neuronal firing rate is less correlated with the dynamic odor time course when distance to the source increases because of improper coding during long odor and no-odor events that characterize large distances. Rapid adaptation during long puffs does not preclude however the detection of puff transitions in PNs. Individual PNs but not individual ORNs encode the onset and offset of odor puffs for any temporal structure of stimuli. A higher spontaneous firing rate coupled to an inhibition phase at the end of PN responses contributes to this coding property. This allows PNs to decode the temporal structure of the odor plume at any distance to the source, an essential piece of information moths can use in their tracking behavior.",['philippe.lucas@inra.fr'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/21/179085,biorxiv,2017,19f91738-7619-47bd-bb19-040c6b716bd4,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/21/179085.full.pdf
Identifying weak signals in inhomogeneous neuronal images for large-scale tracing of neurites,"Shiwei Li, Tingwei Quan, Hang Zhou, FangFang Yin, Anan Li, Ling Fu, Qingming Luo, Hui Gong, Shaoqun Zeng",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Reconstructing neuronal morphology across different regions or even the whole brain is important in many areas of neuroscience research. Large-scale tracing of neurites constitutes the core of this type of reconstruction and has many challenges. One key challenge is how to identify a weak signal from an inhomogeneous background. Here, we addressed this problem by constructing an identification model. In this model, empirical observations made from neuronal images are summarized into rules, which are used to design feature vectors that display the differences between the foreground and background, and a support vector machine is used to learn these feature vectors. We embedded this identification model into a tool that we previously developed, SparseTracer, and termed this integration SparseTracer-Learned Feature Vector (ST-LFV). ST-LFV can trace neurites with extremely weak signals (signal-to-background-noise ratio < 1.1) against an inhomogeneous background. By testing 12 sub-blocks extracted from a whole imaging dataset, ST-LFV can achieve an average recall rate of 0.99 and precision rate of 0.97, which is superior to that of SparseTracer (which has an average recall rate of 0.93 and average precision rate of 0.86), indicating that this method is well suited to weak signal identification. We applied ST-LFV to trace neurites from large-scale images (approximately 105 GB). During the tracing process, obtaining results equivalent to the ground truth required only one round of manual editing for ST-LFV compared to 20 rounds of manual editing for SparseTracer. This improvement in the level of automatic reconstruction indicates that ST-LFV has the potential to rapidly reconstruct sparsely distributed neurons at the scale of an entire brain.",['quantingwei@hust.edu.cn.'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/29/181867,biorxiv,2017,a98a3225-a22c-4bfa-a78c-0fb8f5780bd3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/29/181867.full.pdf

This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals.

Recently, allele-specific analysis in high-throughput reporter assays, such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), have been used to functionally validate non-coding variants. However, we are still missing high-quality and robust data analysis tools for these datasets. We have further developed our method for allele-specific analysis QuASAR (quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads) to analyze allele-specific signals in barcoded read counts data from MPRAs. Using this approach, we can take into account the uncertainty on the original plasmid proportions, over-dispersion, and sequencing errors. The provided allelic skew estimate and its standard error also simplifies meta-analysis of replicate experiments. Additionally, we show that a beta-binomial distribution better models the variability present in the allelic imbalance of these synthetic reporters and results in a test that is statistically well calibrated under the null. Applying this approach to the MPRA data by Tewhey et al (2016), we find 602 SNPs with significant (FDR 10%) allele-specific regulatory function in LCLs.

Identification of HVR3 as a transcriptional regulatory element may contribute to between-individual variability in mitochondrial gene expression. The unique requirement of HSP1 for the TFAM tail may enable its regulation by post-translational modifications.","['cec9@psu.edu', 'ma.williams@northeastern.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/24/129908,biorxiv,2017,b7e75988-f61b-4ef1-9ed3-0c7029d18186,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/24/129908.full.pdf

Breathlessness And The Body: Neuroimaging Evidence For The Inferential Leap," View ORCID ProfileOlivia Faull,  View ORCID ProfileAnja Hayen,  View ORCID ProfileKyle Pattinson",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Breathlessness debilitates millions of people with chronic illness. Mismatch between breathlessness severity and objective disease markers is common and poorly understood. Traditionally, sensory perception was conceptualised as a stimulus-response relationship, although this cannot explain how conditioned symptoms may occur in the absence of physiological signals from the lungs or airways. A Bayesian model is now proposed in which the brain generates sensations based on expectations learned from past experiences (priors), which are then checked against incoming afferent signals. In this model, psychological factors may act as moderators. They may either alter priors, or change the relative attention towards incoming sensory information, leading to more variable interpretation of an equivalent afferent input. In the present study we conducted a preliminary test of this model in a supplementary analysis of previously published data (Hayen 2017). We hypothesised that individual differences in psychological traits (anxiety, depression, anxiety sensitivity) would correlate with the variability of subjective evaluation of equivalent breathlessness challenges. To better understand the resulting inferential leap in the brain, we explored whether these behavioural measures correlated with activity in areas governing either prior generation or sensory afferent input. Behaviorally, anxiety sensitivity was found to positively correlate with each subject's variability of intensity and unpleasantness during mild breathlessness, and with unpleasantness during strong breathlessness. In the brain, anxiety sensitivity was found to positively correlate with activity in the anterior insula during mild breathlessness, and negatively correlate with parietal sensorimotor areas during strong breathlessness. Our findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity may reduce the robustness of this Bayesian sensory perception system, increasing the variability of breathlessness perception and possibly susceptibility to symptom misinterpretation. These preliminary findings in healthy individuals demonstrate how differences in psychological function influence the way we experience bodily sensations, which might direct us towards better understanding of symptom mismatch in clinical populations.",['olivia.faull@ndcn.ox.ac.uk'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/117408,biorxiv,2017,68138454-dc71-40c1-9130-8dea826b8177,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/117408.full.pdf

In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action. 
To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. 
We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond.

Results: Using the same model as the successful Assemblathon competitions, we organized a competitive evaluation in which teams submitted their alignments, and assessments were performed collectively after all the submissions were received. Three datasets were used: two of simulated primate and mammalian phylogenies, and one of 20 real fly genomes. In total 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by ten teams using 12 different alignment pipelines.
Conclusions: We found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments, indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable difference in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions, and found few tools aligned the duplications analysed. We found many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances.

While genome-wide screens are desirable as they provide the most comprehensive interaction profiles, they are resource and time-intensive and sometimes infeasible, depending on the species and experimental platform. For these scenarios, optimal methods for more efficient screening while still producing the maximal amount of information from the resulting profiles are of interest. To address this problem, we developed an optimal algorithm, called COMPRESS-GI, which selects a small but informative set of genes that captures most of the functional information contained within genome-wide genetic interaction profiles. The utility of this algorithm is demonstrated through an application of the approach to define a diagnostic mutant set for large-scale chemical genetic screens, where more than 13,000 compound screens were achieved through the increased throughput enabled by the approach.

Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g. the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally.

We recorded EEG from human participants (both genders) while they performed a modified Eriksen flanker task in which distractors and targets flickered within (10 Hz) or outside (7.5 or 15 Hz) the alpha band. By using a combination of EEG source separation, time-frequency, and single-trial linear mixed effects modeling, we demonstrate that 10 Hz flicker interfered with stimulus processing more on incongruent than congruent trials (high vs. low selective attention demands). Crucially, the effect of 10 Hz flicker on task performance was predicted by the distance between 10 Hz and individual alpha peak frequency (estimated during the task). Finally, the flicker effect on task performance was more strongly predicted by EEG flicker responses during stimulus processing than during preparation for the upcoming stimulus, suggesting that 10 Hz flicker interfered more with reactive than proactive selective attention. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that visual flicker entrained endogenous alpha-band networks, which in turn impaired task performance.

We recorded vStr gamma oscillations across a 1.4mm2 grid spanned by 64 recording electrodes as rats rested and foraged for rewards, revealing a highly consistent power gradient originating in the adjacent piriform cortex. Phase differences across the vStr were consistently small (<10 degrees) and current source density analysis further confirmed the absence of local sink-source pairs in the vStr. Reversible occlusions of the ipsilateral (but not contralateral) nostril, known to abolish gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, strongly reduced vStr gamma power and the occurrence of transient gamma-band events.

Aberrant prefrontal beta oscillations predict episodic memory encoding deficits in schizophrenia,"Federica Meconi, Sarah Anderl-Straub, Heidelore Raum, Michael Landgrebe, Berthold Langguth, Karl-Heinz Baeuml, Simon Hanslmayr",Now published in NeuroImage: Clinical. 2016,"Verbal episodic memory is one of the core cognitive functions affected in patients suffering from schizophrenia (SZ). Although this verbal memory impairment in SZ is a well-known finding, our understanding about its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms is rather scarce. Here we address this issue by recording brain oscillations during a memory task in a sample of healthy controls and patients suffering from SZ. Brain oscillations represent spectral fingerprints of specific neurocognitive operations and are therefore a promising tool to identify neurocognitive mechanisms that are affected by SZ. Healthy controls showed a prominent suppression of left prefrontal beta oscillatory activity during successful memory formation, which replicates several previous oscillatory memory studies. In contrast, patients failed to exhibit such left prefrontal beta power suppression. Utilizing a new topographical pattern similarity approach, we further demonstrate that the degree of similarity between a patients beta power decrease to that of the controls reliably predicted memory performance. This relationship between beta power decreases and memory was such that the patients memory performance improved as they showed a more similar topographical beta desynchronization pattern compared to that of healthy controls. These findings suggest that left prefrontal beta power suppression (or lack thereof) during memory encoding is a possible biomarker for the observed encoding impairments in SZ in verbal memory. This lack of left prefrontal beta power decreases might indicate a specific semantic processing deficit of verbal material in patients with schizophrenia.","['federica.meconi@unipd.it', 's.hanslmayr@bham.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/29/061291,biorxiv,2016,3d26b380-90e2-43e9-87eb-72533ad1fc03,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/29/061291.full.pdf
Persistent vulnerability to relapse despite complete extinction of cocaine craving,"Paul Girardeau, Sylvia Navailles, Audrey Durand, Caroline Vouillac-Mendoza, Karine Guillem, Serge H Ahmed",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Craving often precedes relapse into cocaine addiction. This explains why considerable research effort is being expended to try to develop anti-craving strategies for relapse prevention. Recently, we discovered using the classic reinstatement model of cocaine craving that the reinstating or priming effect of cocaine can be extinguished with repeated priming in rats, a phenomenon dubbed extinction of cocaine priming. Here we sought to measure the potential beneficial effect of this novel extinction strategy on subsequent relapse (i.e., return to the pre-extinction pattern of cocaine self-administration once the drug is made again available after extinction). Overall and contrary to our initial hope, extensive and complete extinction of cocaine priming had no major impact on relapse. This lack of effect occurred despite evidence for post-extinction loss of neuronal responses to cocaine priming in brain regions critically involved in cocaine-induced reinstatement (i.e., the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens). An effect of extinction of cocaine priming on relapse was only observed when cocaine was available for self-administration under more demanding conditions. However, this effect was modest and short-lived. Finally, we succeeded to trace the origin of our failure to prevent relapse to a persistent, extinction-resistant form of operant behavior that is not directly induced by cocaine. This extinction-resistant behavior is commonly reported, though generally ignored as causally irrelevant, in many other reinstatement studies. We propose that this behavior should become both a novel marker for long-term vulnerability to relapse and a novel target for preclinical development of potential relapse prevention interventions.",['serge.ahmed@u-bordeaux.fr'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/26/050401,biorxiv,2016,e1063ace-b16d-4046-999f-7d0b5e79d7b3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/26/050401.full.pdf
Neural oscillations as a signature of efficient coding in the presence of synaptic delays,"Matthew Chalk, Boris Gutkin, Sophie Deneve",Now published in eLife. 2015,"Cortical networks exhibit ""global oscillations"", in which neural spike times are entrained to an underlying oscillatory rhythm, but where individual neurons fire irregularly, on only a fraction of cycles. While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a ""prediction error"" while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is achieved when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/17/034736,biorxiv,2015,6286fe4d-a140-4260-a6d6-fdaba020fef3,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/17/034736.full.pdf
Vision and locomotion shape the interactions between neuron types in mouse visual cortex,"Mario Dipoppa, Adam Ranson, Michael Krumin, Marius Pachitariu, Matteo Carandini, Kenneth D Harris",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), sensory responses are shaped by behavioral factors such as locomotion. These factors are thought to control a disinhibitory circuit, whereby interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) inhibit those expressing somatostatin (Sst), disinhibiting pyramidal cells (Pyr). We measured the effect of locomotion on these neurons and on interneurons expressing parvalbumin (Pvalb) in layer 2/3 of mouse V1, and found inconsistencies with the disinhibitory model. In the presence of large stimuli, locomotion increased Sst cell responses without suppressing Vip cells. In the presence of small stimuli, locomotion increased Vip cell responses without suppressing Sst cells. A circuit model could reproduce each cell type's activity from the measured activity of other cell types, but only if we allowed locomotion to increase feedforward synaptic weights while modulating recurrent weights. These results suggest that locomotion alters cortical function by changing effective synaptic connectivity, rather than only through disinhibition.",[],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/058396,biorxiv,2017,ebed9a0a-86f0-4bce-9a4f-3ecf0c7a8962,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/058396.full.pdf

However, most commercially available sequencing technologies are ill-suited for space flight for a variety of reasons, including excessive volume and mass, and insufficient ruggedization for spaceflight. Portable and lightweight nanopore-based sequencers, which analyze nucleic acids electrochemically, are inherently much better suited to spaceflight, and could potentially be incorporated into future missions with only minimal modification. As a first step toward evaluating the performance of nanopore sequencers in a microgravity environment, we tested the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinIONTM in a parabolic flight simulator to examine the effect of reduced gravity on DNA sequencing. The instrument successfully generated three reads, averaging 2,371 bases. However, the median current was shifted across all reads and the error profiles changed compared with operation of the sequencer on the ground, indicating that distinct computational methods may be needed for such data. We evaluated existing methods and propose two new methods; the first new method is based on a wave-fingerprint method similar to that of the Shazam model for matching periodicity information in music, and the second is based on entropy signal mapping. These tools provide a unique opportunity for nucleic acid sequencing in reduced gravity environments.

It remains unclear whether the LC acts functionally as a single global effector or as discrete modules. Specifically, while spinal-projections from LC neurons can exert analgesic actions, it is not known whether they can act independently of ascending LC projections. Using viral vectors taken up at axon terminals, we expressed chemogenetic actuators selectively in LC neurons with spinal (LC:SC) or prefrontal cortex (LC:PFC) projections. Activation of the LC:SC module produced robust, lateralised analgesia while activation of LC:PFC produced aversion. In a neuropathic pain model, LC:SC activation reduced hind-limb sensitization and induced conditioned place preference. By contrast, activation of LC:PFC exacerbated spontaneous pain, produced aversion and increased anxiety-like behaviour. This independent, contrasting modulation of pain-related behaviours mediated by distinct noradrenergic modules provides evidence for a discrete functional organisation of the LC.","['s.hirschberg@bristol.ac.uk', 'Yong.Li@bristol.ac.uk', 'A.Randall@exeter.ac.uk', 'eric.kremer@igmm.cnrs.fr', 'Tony.Pickering@Bristol.ac.uk', 'Tony.Pickering@Bristol.ac.uk']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/27/156307,biorxiv,2017,126e23d3-1f96-4cb3-a890-d4fd2981a18f,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/27/156307.full.pdf

As the term 'dynamic functional connectivity' implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes. Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arise under different configurations of local dynamics and inter-system coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or non-stationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity and flexibility.

Effects Of Small-Scale Clustering Of Flowers On Pollinator Foraging Behaviour And Flower Visitation Rate," View ORCID ProfileAsma Akter,  View ORCID ProfilePaolo Biella,  View ORCID ProfileJan Klecka",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2017,"Plants are often distributed in clusters of various sizes and have a variable number of flowers per inflorescence. This small-scale spatial clustering affects insect foraging strategies and plant reproductive success. In our study, we aimed to determine how visitation rate and foraging behaviour of pollinators depend on the number of flowers per plant and on the size of clusters of multiple plants using Dracocephalum moldavica (Lamiaceae) as a target species. We measured flower visitation rate by observations of insects visiting single plants and clusters of plants with different numbers of flowers. Detailed data on foraging behaviour within clusters of different sizes were gathered for honeybees, Apis mellifera, the most abundant visitor of Dracocephalum in the experiments. We found that the total number of flower visitors increased with the increasing number of flowers on individual plants and in larger clusters, but less then proportionally. Although individual honeybees visited more flowers in larger clusters, they visited a smaller proportion of flowers, as has been previously observed. Consequently, visitation rate per flower and unit time peaked in clusters with an intermediate number of flowers. These patterns do not conform to expectations based on optimal foraging theory and the ideal free distribution model. We attribute this discrepancy to incomplete information about the distribution of resources. Detailed observations and video recordings of individual honeybees also showed that the number of flowers had no effect on handling time of flowers by honeybees.

Facile semi-automated forensic body fluid identification by multiplex solution hybridization of NanoString® barcode probes to specific mRNA targets,"Patrick Danaher, Robin Lynn White, Erin Hanson, Jack Ballantyne",Now published in Forensic Science International: Genetics. 2014,"A DNA profile from the perpetrator does not reveal, per se, the circumstances by which it was transferred. Body fluid identification by mRNA profiling may allow extraction of contextual 'activity level' information from forensic samples. Here we describe the development of a prototype multiplex digital gene expression (DGE) method for forensic body fluid/tissue identification based upon solution hybridization of color-coded NanoString® probes to 23 tissue/body fluid specific mRNA targets. The body fluids/tissues targeted were peripheral blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin. We tested and compared a simple 5 minute room temperature cellular lysis protocol against standard RNA isolation from same source material as a means to facilitate ease-of-use in forensic sample processing.
We first describe a model for gene expression in a sample from a single body fluid and then extend that model to mixtures of body fluids.  We then describe calculation of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of body fluid quantities in a sample, and we describe the use of likelihood ratios to test for the presence of each body fluid in a sample.  Known single source blood, semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin samples all demonstrated the expected tissue specific gene expression for at least two of the chosen biomarkers. Saliva samples were more problematic, with their previously identified characteristic genes exhibiting poor specificity. Nonetheless the most specific saliva biomarker, HTN3, was expressed at a higher level in saliva than in any of the other tissues. As a preliminary indication of the ability of the method to discern admixtures of body fluids, five mixtures were prepared. Two of the five mixtures were called perfectly using the assay algorithm, and one of the component fluids was identified in the each of the 'false negative' mixtures.  Crucially, our algorithm produced zero false positive fluid identifications across this study's 98 samples. Further optimization of the biomarker 'Codeset' will be required before it can be used in casework, particularly with respect to increasing the signal to noise ratio of the saliva biomarkers.  With suitable modifications, this simplified protocol with minimal hands on requirement should facilitate routine use of mRNA profiling in casework laboratories.",['Jack.Ballantyne@ucf.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/08/12/007898,biorxiv,2014,3e5bf893-27e3-4fa9-9213-50cc7bb7a224,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/08/12/007898.full.pdf

However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of using the limited information from a global movement evaluation to optimise behaviour by guiding the plasticity in numerous neurones. We identify the possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create an eligibility trace for plasticity and signal resulting error changes to guide plasticity. These error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors, generates specific predictions for synaptic plasticity rules that contradict the current consensus. However, in vitro plasticity experiments under physiological conditions verified our predictions, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to unphysiological conditions. Using numerical and analytical approaches we demonstrate the convergence and estimate the capacity of learning in our implementation.

Role of somatostatin-positive cortical interneurons in the generation of sleep slow waves,"Giulio Tononi, Chiara Cirelli, Chadd M Funk, Kayla Peelman, Michele Bellesi, William Marshall",Now published in The Journal of Neuroscience. 2017,"Cortical slow waves,  the hallmark of NREM sleep,  reflect near-synchronous OFF periods in cortical neurons. However, the mechanisms triggering such OFF periods are unclear, as there is little evidence for somatic inhibition. We studied cortical inhibitory interneurons that express somatostatin (SOM), because ~70% of them are Martinotti cells that target diffusely layer 1 and can block excitatory transmission presynaptically, at glutamatergic terminals, and postsynaptically, at apical dendrites, without inhibiting the soma. In freely moving mice, we show that SOM+ cells can fire immediately before slow waves and their optogenetic stimulation triggers neuronal OFF periods during sleep. Next, we show that chemogenetic activation of SOM+ cells increases slow wave activity (SWA), the slope of individual slow waves, and the duration of NREM sleep; whereas their chemogenetic inhibition decreases SWA and slow wave incidence without changing time spent asleep. By contrast, activation of parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells, the most numerous population of cortical inhibitory neurons, greatly decreases SWA and cortical firing. These results indicate that SOM+ cells, but not PV+ cells, are involved in the generation of sleep slow waves. Whether Martinotti cells are solely responsible for this effect, or are complemented by other classes of inhibitory neurons, remains to be investigated.","['ccirelli@wisc.edu', 'gtononi@wisc.edu', 'ccirelli@wisc.edu', 'gtononi@wisc.edu']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/088443,biorxiv,2017,729311ae-9698-4918-87b3-e2f4c05c38b1,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/088443.full.pdf

Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association to the transposable elements, which is contrast to the findings in Arabidopsis. Generally, imprinting of rice is conserved within species, but intraspecific variations were confirmed here. Imprinting between cultivated rice and wild rice are likely similar. The imprinted genes of rice do not show significant selective signatures overall, which suggests that domestication imposes limited evolutionary effects on genomic imprinting of rice.

The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of MDD, and implicated prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the pathophysiology of MDD (regions exhibiting anatomical differences between MDD cases and controls). Genes that are targets of antidepressant medications were strongly enriched for MDD association signals (P=8.5x10-10), suggesting the relevance of these findings for improved pharmacotherapy of MDD. Sets of genes involved in gene splicing and in creating isoforms were also enriched for smaller MDD GWA P-values, and these gene sets have also been implicated in schizophrenia and autism.

Our analyses suggested important relations of genetic risk for MDD with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: the genetic basis of lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal for MDD whereas MDD and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for MDD, and a continuous measure of risk underlies the observed clinical phenotype.

"Dynamic species classification of microorganisms across time, abiotic and biotic environments - a sliding window approach"," View ORCID ProfileFrank Pennekamp, Jason I. Griffiths,  View ORCID ProfileEmanuel A. Fronhofer, Mathew Seymour, Aurélie Garnier, Florian Altermatt, Owen L. Petchey",Now published in PLOS ONE. 2017,"Technological advances have greatly simplified to take and analyze digital images and videos, and ecologists increasingly use these techniques for trait, behavioral and taxonomic analyses. The development of techniques to automate biological measurements from the environment opens up new possibilities to infer species numbers, observe presence/absence patterns and recognize individuals based on audio-visual information. 
Streams of quantitative data, such as temporal species abundances, are processed by machine learning (ML) algorithms into meaningful information. Machine learning approaches learn to distinguish classes (e.g., species) from observed quantitative features (phenotypes), and in-turn predict the distinguished classes in subsequent observations. However, in biological systems, the environment changes, often driving  phenotypic changes in behaviour and morphology. 
Here we describe a framework for classifying species under dynamic biotic and abiotic conditions using a novel sliding window approach. We train a random forest classifier on subsets of the data, covering restricted temporal, biotic and abiotic ranges (i.e. windows). We test our approach by applying the classification framework to experimental microbial communities where results were validated against manual classification. Individuals from one to six ciliate species were monitored over hundreds of generations in dozens of different species combinations and over a temperature gradient. We describe the steps of our classification pipeline and systematically explore the effects of the abiotic and biotic environments as well as temporal effects on classification success. 
Differences in biotic and abiotic conditions caused simplistic classification approaches to be unsuccessful. In contrast, the sliding window approach allowed classification to be highly successful, because phenotypic differences driven by environmental change could be captured in the learning algorithm. Importantly, automatic classification showed comparable success compared to manual identifications.
Our framework allows for reliable classification even in dynamic environmental contexts, and may help to improve long-term monitoring of species from environmental samples. It therefore has application in disciplines with automatic enumeration and phenotyping of organisms such as eco-toxicology, ecology and evolutionary ecology, and broad-scale environmental monitoring.","['frank.pennekamp@ieu.uzh.ch', 'ths@she', 'emanuel.fronhofer@eawag.ch', 'aurelie.garnier@ieu.uzh.ch', 'm.seymour@bangor.ac.uk', 'orian.altermatt@eawag.ch', 'owen.petchey@ieu.uzh.ch']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/02/105395,biorxiv,2017,d7947ff3-b1f7-4677-bfe1-fc59fd9d3eb9,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/02/105395.full.pdf

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification make it an unusually well-preserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens. 
Objective: We present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach. 
Methods: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and UPLC-MS/MS for further characterization of polar metabolites and lipids, respectively. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss. 
Results: Dipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples. 
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that certain metabolite classes have higher potential for recovery over long time scales and may serve as appropriate targets for oral microbiome evolutionary studies.","['warinner@shh.mpg.de', 'warinner@shh.mpg.de']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/09/136176,biorxiv,2017,7ecbd24d-acab-4fd2-8550-ad0b6bc191cb,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/09/136176.full.pdf

Here, we propose that learning reward values of individual features can provide a heuristic for estimating reward values of choice options in dynamic, multi-dimensional environments. We hypothesized that this feature-based learning occurs not just because it can reduce dimensionality, but more importantly because it can increase adaptability without compromising precision of learning. We experimentally tested this hypothesis and found that in dynamic environments, human subjects adopted feature-based learning even when this approach does not reduce dimensionality. Even in static, low-dimensional environments, subjects initially adopted feature-based learning and gradually switched to learning reward values of individual options, depending on how accurately objects' values can be predicted by combining feature values. Our computational models reproduced these results and highlight the importance of neurons coding feature values for parallel learning of values for features and objects.",['soltani@dartmouth.edu'],http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/29/097741,biorxiv,2017,026be647-4ff8-4feb-aeba-bcd724008402,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/29/097741.full.pdf
No evidence that sex and transposable elements drive genome size variation in evening primroses,"J Arvid Agren, Stephan Greiner, Marc TJ Johnson, Stephen I Wright",Now published in Evolution. 2014,"Genome size varies dramatically across species, but despite an abundance of attention there is little agreement on the relative contributions of selective and neutral processes in governing this variation. The rate of sexual reproduction can potentially play an important role in genome size evolution because of its effect on the efficacy of selection and transmission of transposable elements. Here, we used a phylogenetic comparative approach and whole genome sequencing to investigate the contribution of sex and transposable element content to genome size variation in the evening primrose (Oenothera) genus. We determined genome size using flow cytometry from 30 Oenothera species of varying reproductive system and find that variation in sexual/asexual reproduction cannot explain the almost two-fold variation in genome size. Moreover, using whole genome sequences of three species of varying genome sizes and reproductive system, we found that genome size was not associated with transposable element abundance; instead the larger genomes had a higher abundance of simple sequence repeats. Although it has long been clear that sexual reproduction may affect various aspects of genome evolution in general and transposable element evolution in particular, it does not appear to have played a major role in the evening primroses.","['arvid.agren@utoronto.ca', 'greiner@mpimp-golm.mpg.de', 'marc.johnson@utoronto.ca', 'stephen.wright@utoronto.ca']",http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/07/16/007161,biorxiv,2014,f60926ca-b510-41c1-975a-8404799f4fae,1,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/07/16/007161.full.pdf

We compared fMRI response time series between corresponding brain regions across pairs of individuals and found that neural response similarity decreased with increasing distance in the social network. These effects persisted after controlling for demographic similarity.

However, such studies are typically conducted on different datasets, using different validation strategies, and different metrics. In this study, different methods were compared using one single standardized dataset obtained from ChEMBL, which is made available to the public, using standardized metrics (BEDROC and Matthews Correlation Coefficient). Specifically, the performance of Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Deep Neural Networks was assessed using QSAR and proteochemometric (PCM) methods. All methods were validated using both a random split validation and a temporal validation, with the latter being a more realistic benchmark of expected prospective execution. Deep Neural Networks are the top performing classifiers, highlighting the added value of Deep Neural Networks over other more conventional methods. Moreover, the best method (""DNN_PCM"") performed significantly better at almost one standard deviation higher than the mean performance. Furthermore, Multi task and PCM implementations were shown to improve performance over single task Deep Neural Networks. Conversely, target prediction performed almost two standard deviations under the mean performance. Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression performed around mean performance. Finally, using an ensemble of DNNs, alongside additional tuning, enhanced the relative performance by another 27% (compared with unoptimized DNN_PCM).

Multivariate cross-frequency coupling via generalized eigendecomposition,Michael Cohen,Now published in eLife. 2017,"This paper presents a new framework for analyzing cross-frequency coupling in multichannel electrophysiological recordings. The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions -- attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. Five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, with validations in simulated data and applications in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise where traditional CFC methods perform poorly. It is also demonstrated that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, with significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses.

Detecting hierarchical 3-D genome domain reconfiguration with network modularity,"Heidi K Norton, Harvey Huang, Daniel J Emerson, Jesi Kim, Shi Gu, Danielle S Bassett, Jennifer E Phillips-Cremins",Retrieved from bioRxiv. 2016,"Mammalian genomes are folded in a hierarchy of topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs and looping interactions. The nested nature of chromatin domains has rendered it challenging to identify a sensitive and specific metric for detecting subTADs and quantifying their dynamic reconfiguration across cellular states. Here, we apply graph theoretic principles to quantify hierarchical folding patterns in high-resolution chromatin topology maps. We discover that TADs can be accurately detected using a Louvain-like locally greedy algorithm to maximize network modularity. By varying a resolution parameter in the modularity quality function, we accurately partition the mouse genome across length scales into a hierarchical nested structure of network communities exhibiting a wide range of sizes. To distinguish high probability subTADs from the full detected set, we developed and applied a new hierarchical spatial variance minimization method. Moreover, we identified a large number of dynamically altered communities between pluripotent embryonic stem cells and multipotent neural progenitor cells. Cell type specific boundaries correlate with trends in dynamic occupancy of the architectural protein CTCF, thereby validating their biological relevance. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of metrics from network science in quantifying a nested hierarchy of dynamic 3D chromatin communities across length scales.

High-throughput “deep” sequencing can now measure this diversity in unprecedented detail, particularly since it can be performed at different timepoints during an infection, and this offers a potentially powerful way to infer the evolutionary dynamics of the intra-host viral population. However, population genomic inference from HIV sequence data is challenging because of high rates of mutation and recombination, rapid demographic changes, and ongoing selective pressures. In this paper we develop a new method for inference using HIV deep sequencing data using an approach based on importance sampling of ancestral recombination graphs under a multi-locus coalescent model. The approach further extends recent progress in the approximation of so-called conditional sampling distributions, a quantity of key interest when approximating coalescent likelihoods. The chief novelties of our method are that it is able to infer rates of recombination and mutation, as well as the effective population size, while handling sampling over different timepoints and missing data without extra computational difficulty. We apply our method to a dataset of HIV-1, in which several hundred sequences were obtained from an infected individual at seven timepoints over two years.
